This website was made in the purpose of creating a digital home to collect the writing and the work I do. The last couple of years I have downsized on my social media appearance and wanted to have a simple home where I can experiment at my own pace.

- The website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
- It’s hand coded with HTML and CSS.
- No frameworks were used in the creation of this site.
- SASS helps CSS maintenance.
- Workflow automations are happening with Gulp.
- I use Bower to keep a good overview of packages.
- The website is currently hosted at [MediaTemple](https://www.mediatemple.net/).
- My profile photo is taken by [Erik Carlsson](http://erikcarlsson.se/).

I see this website as my playground so I don’t always worry how it looks across various browsers. But I’m keen about accessibility and usability issues so if you find something I might have missed, please let me know.
