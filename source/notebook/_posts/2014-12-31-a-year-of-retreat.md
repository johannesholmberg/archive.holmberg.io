The year 2014 was the year when I didn’t do a thing at all. Of course I did things, but nothing in the big memorable sense.

Ever since college there’s alway happened to be at least one big major life-changing event on an annual basis. But not this year. This year I’ve happened to stay holed up in my apartment, no traveling, no big vacation. Just recuperation. Doing my work methodically. Preparing myself mentally.

I knew that things were brewing inside but I had to let it take some time. I wanted 2014 to be the year that I marked *without* a label and stowed it away. Sort of an “in-between” year.

Cause 2015 is awaiting around the corner and I know that 2015 is going to be a hell of a ride. 2015 I’m going to leave my home country for the third time now and settle down with my girlfriend in Switzerland. 2015 I’m going to start my own business. 2015 is going to mean a lot of traveling and also a lot of unknowns.

The next year is going to fly past me and shower me in so many new experiences. I want to be prepared for it. That is why I wanted to let this year be as “empty”, methodical and non-exciting as it has been. That is why I summarize 2014 as a year of retreat.
