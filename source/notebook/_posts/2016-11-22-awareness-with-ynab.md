I've been using a budgeting service called [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) for almost two years now and would like to share some of my thoughts on it.

The way I've handled my finances in the past has been in a pretty strict fashion. I took a rather big chunk of my monthly paycheck (maybe around a third or so) and put it away on a savings account. Then I lived through the month with the rest of the money I had on hand.

By taking this away directly at the beginning of the month I grew accustomed to spend less, since I had to adjust my spendings after what money I had left. I never felt there was anything wrong with this type of approach and I managed to save a substantial amount by keeping to it over the years.

But then I stumbled upon YNAB.

{% assign ext = "png" %}
{% assign attributes = "figure--margins" %}
{% assign alt = "" %}
{% assign caption = "The web interface of YNAB" %}
{% include responsive-image.html %}

It wasn't like a revelation at first or anything but I'm curious in ideas that can provide me with extra value, without requiring too much effort from my side. So I started to try it out.

YNAB is actually not a tool to keep track of everything you’re spending (even though it provides that as well.) YNAB is a systematic set of ideas to approach budgeting.

## Virtual pockets of money
The heart and soul to this approach consists of categories, but I like to call them pockets. You initially set them up for your budget and then tweak them as you learn. I sat up a few expenses that I knew we have on a regular basis like "Rent", "Electricity", "Health insurance" etc. I also set up a few generic categories like "Fun money" (for eating out, going to the cinema etc.) and "Personal" (for all physical things, clothes, shoes etc.).

When the categories were set up I started delegating my money to them.

{% assign filename = "ynab-2" %}
{% assign ext = "png" %}
{% assign attributes = "figure--margins" %}
{% assign alt = "" %}
{% assign caption = "A few categories set up in YNAB" %}
{% include responsive-image.html %}

Now this is something really cool. I know what my money is doing. Before, I knew that for instance I had $8000 on my savings account (felt also good, sure) but I never knew what that money was supposed to do.

My grandparents used to budget by putting money in different envelopes and then label them. This is the exact same philosophy, only that my money lives in these "virtual pockets". It gave me a new clarity in how to handle money.

## Long term goals
After a few months of using YNAB, I started to figure out its real power—setting priorities. I can set up any goal I want and start budgeting my money in order to achieve that goal. No matter how big or small it is.

{% assign filename = "ynab-3" %}
{% assign alt = "" %}
{% assign caption = "" %}
{% include responsive-image.html %}

One thing I knew I wanted to buy in a later stage was a bicycle. I didn't need it right away but wanted to have the money ready for when I was. So I sat up another category, or a pocket, and month by month dedicated a little bit of money to it. It wasn't much, but now close to two years later I have over $1000 in there. Boy oh boy will it feel good to buy that bike in the spring.

## Money by job, not by location
The beauty of this process is that I don't need to shuffle around money between a lot of different bank accounts. In fact, one account is enough. I always know exactly what the parts of my money is dedicated to do. If I log in

## The monthly "meeting"
Once every month, usually when the paycheck comes in, me and Linda will have a meeting to look over our priorities and see that we're on track with our values at the time. This is also a good opportunity
