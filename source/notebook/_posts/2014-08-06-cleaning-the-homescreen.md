A couple of weeks ago I did a little decluttering of my iPhone’s homescreen and I’m pretty happy with the outcome.

{% assign filename = "homescreen" %}
{% assign alt = "iPhone" %}
{% assign attributes = "margins portrait" %}
{% include responsive-image.html %}

My idea was to single out all the apps I use on a daily basis and place them directly on the homescreen; the rest is dropped in the ‘Utilities’ folder where they’re accessed by using the splendid search functionality in iOS 7. The result is this.

- [Runkeeper’s](http://runkeeper.com/home) the app I use to track down walks, swimming, bicycling and hiking trips.

- I use RSS to collect my favorite blogs and my app of choice for reading them is through [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/ios/).

- Everything of my digital life goes into [Evernote](https://evernote.com). And with that I mean *everything*. I used Evernote for years without realizing its full potential. Now it functions as kind of my own personalized database.

- Safari is my browser of choice.

- The alarm clock I’m using to get up in the morning is [Rise](http://www.simplebots.co/). Beautiful and simple. Design at its best.

- My preferable choice of listening to music is still through the native app. The organization and overview of the collection is outstanding.

- Even with the introduction of control center, I still find myself flipping through the Settings app at least once a day.

- [Sunrise](https://calendar.sunrise.am/) is the simple calendar app that I enjoy glancing at to get a quick overview of my day.

- [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) is Dropbox idea of how e-mail software should look and work like. I agree.

- [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) is my todo app of choice where I put everything that has to get done. Using it both for personal and work related tasks.

- [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) is amazing. When I discovered it, it completely changed the way I do input on the iPhone. Everything that needs to be written—I do it through Drafts, then process it to the correct app—be it to Evernote, Todoist, email or sending a text.
