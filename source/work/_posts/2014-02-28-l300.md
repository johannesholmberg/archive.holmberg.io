**In early 2014** I got the chance to work on the new responsive website for L300. It was already built in WordPress and the challenge lay in taking the current code framework (which was a static layout) and convert it into a full-fledged responsive website.
{: .intro}

Due to certain restraints regarding budget and time, the goal was trying to work with the design framework that was already in place as much as possible and rather tweak it as needed instead of jumping into a full launch redesign.

The solution is a progressive enhanced website with the modified CSS structured in a “mobile-first” fashion.

{% assign filename =  "l300-inline-1" %}
{% assign ext = "jpg" %}
{% assign alt = page.title %}
{% include responsive-image.html %}
