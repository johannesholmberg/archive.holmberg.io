I was hired to develop the front-end and WordPress integration for a new responsive, digital home to a PR agency in New Zealand.

I did the same thing as I usually do when getting a design delivered for front-end development—extract the components to make separate markup/styling/script files. This work will be the foundation for how I architect the structure in WordPress.

In WordPress I create custom post types for the different kind of content the website needs to have, with adapted input fields so it just accepts the type of data relevant to the current type of content. Then I take these components/custom post types and make reusable blocks for the administrator. So that later they can build their pages by dragging and dropping these blocks in the order they want.

That’s been by my approach for creating dynamic WordPress sites over the last few years and the feedback is still very good every time the clients get their hands on the solution.
