This spring I got to work on a very interesting project. It was for an organization in New Zealand and was to become a donation portal for children in need. The requirement was to build a platform on WordPress.

Each campaign was going to be a single page with sections that should be fully customizable in WordPress. So all campaigns didn’t need to have the same structure but they should be comprised by the same components. A bit like drag and drop around blocks to create the page.

I used ACF for WordPress to create these separate blocks which would build up the campaign. The whole payment solution was built against the Ubiquity API.

This was a project involving a bit more backend programming that I’m used to, but it was fun and challenging. The project had a tight deadline to go live before the campaign launched nation wide in New Zealand which gave another challenge to the table.
