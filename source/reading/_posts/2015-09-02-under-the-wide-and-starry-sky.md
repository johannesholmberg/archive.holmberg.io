<p class="intro" markdown="1">**I'm** terribly in love with this genre that fictionalize biography. Reading about real events but shaped in a story draws me in on a deeper level than just being presented with plain facts. I was happily surprised when I saw that Nancy Horan – author of *[Loving Frank]({{ site.url }}/reading/loving-frank)* – had written a new book in the same format.</p>

This time it touches on the life of [Robert Louis Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson) and his wife Fanny as they're traveling the world and making a living together. It's a book full of spirit and joy of life, and it's an interesting aspect that it's written from both perspectives of Louis and Fanny. That way you get to see them both from their own subjective mind but also how they appear externally.

I learned so much from this book and got new perspectives thanks to these colorful characters. I read the Kindle version and the highlights I made through the book is down below.
