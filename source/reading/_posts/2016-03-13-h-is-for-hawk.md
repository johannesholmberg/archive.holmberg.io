A memoir written by Helen Macdonald. Her father has died and in way of coping with it she acquires a hawk, with the intention of training it.
{: .intro}

Helen has always been into falconry since she was little and is fascinated by the birds. Her father had the same type of fascination, almost bordering to obsession, over airplanes. As a boy he could go to the hills in the morning, lay down and just look up into the sky, for as long as twelve hours. She must have gotten the passion from him. The hawk's name is Mabel and together, Helen and Mabel learn about life from each other.

I wanted to like this book so much but it never really touched me. The writing is beautiful but every time I sat down with this book I felt so sorry for the author. It was as if I had a knot in my stomach all the way through reading it.

Fortunately, I managed to find some nice highlights that agree with me.
