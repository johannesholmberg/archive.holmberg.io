<p class="intro" markdown="1">**When I read** a Murakami book these days, it's usually to clear up my brain a bit. Make space for new stuff. His short story collections is a perfect way for this purpose. They’re a mix of everything, some makes you laugh, others makes you think. It’s a good recipe for a brain reset.</p>

These are my highlights.
