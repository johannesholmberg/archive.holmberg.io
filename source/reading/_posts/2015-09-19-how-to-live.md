Montaigne invented the essay. In the late 16th century he started recording everything he did and felt on paper. Peoples response to this when reading him was that they felt as if Montaigne knew them deeply, under the skin.

By writing openly about himself, others connected and recognized themselves in him on a whole new global level, and that was unlike anything before at the time.

This book is biographical both on Montaigne himself but also how his work has survived the centuries.

I found a lot of inspiration to take away and share my highlights below. I read the Kindle version as usual.
