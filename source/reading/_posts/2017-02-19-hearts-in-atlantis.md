I’ve finished my first audio book ever. When I read Stephen King’s autobiography earlier this year, I decided that I wanted to go through a few of his novels. I started with _Hearts in Atlantis_. The experience of “reading” this as an audio book was interesting. I listened to it everywhere I could; while walking, on the tram, when cooking lunch.

It was a bit over 20 hours all in all so in order to finish it, I had to find every scrap of time I could to proceed.

The novel is composed out of five interconnected stories. They all relate to the sixties and the Vietnam War. They all touch on the subject of growing up, with our incidents that shape us for life. This is not a horror story at all but a very beautiful, touching description on the joys of boyhood.

It was a soothing experience in listening to an audio book, but the drawback of it is that I don’t have any highlights from the book.
