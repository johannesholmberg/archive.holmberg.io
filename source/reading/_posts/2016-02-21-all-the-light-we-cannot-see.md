Werner Pfennig and Marie-Laure LeBlanc, two children with different backgrounds, growing up in two different cultures, in two different countries during terrible circumstances.
{: .intro}

I started reading this book because it's the topic of the next book club meeting I'm attending. It took quite a while to finish it but I was hooked directly from the start. The chapters are small and very concise, telling the story parallel between Werner and Marie-Laure's different worlds. The story line is not chronological but jumps back and forth in time. It makes for a very interesting reading experience.

I loved the way the book describes the essence of life from these two main characters sides. It's set during Second World War and I feel that I've gotten a much deeper understanding of how it was to be alive during this time, from both sides.
