For two intensive weeks I've been immersed in this book. And just as with [The Tin Drum] I finished the same day as I had my meeting with the book club for discussing it.
{: .intro}

It was a book I had some trouble with in the beginning. The language and the viewpoint from a 16 year old girl is not usually what I prefer to read. But as I found out later, this is only one of the styles the author uses throughout the book. Underlying all this is a bigger story of a battle going on between good and evil.

The most fascinating aspect of the book is its structure in a time perspective. The story spans the lifetime over several characters. And to be able to follow these characters for such a long time was something new to me. You get to know them and feel how they grow over time. I enjoyed the book very much and couldn't really stop reading once I had picked it up (and passed the first part, which I had most trouble with.)

I read it on the Kindle and my highlights are below.
