I read this book as part of my [learning German project] in October. The language level was just on the right level for me to keep it interesting.

I could follow what happened pretty well and learned some new words along the way. I think reading Murakami must be perfect for learning a new language. He has a very natural style using simple words. And he has that ability to describe people in time which attracts me so much. That’s why I keep coming back for more.

I didn’t highlight so much throughout the book this time but I think the few I have captures Murakami’s style pretty much.
