Time to read another book within my field. _Atomic Design_ is Brad Frost’s approach to designing systems instead of pages. I like the concept and have been working this way for a time, I’ve just not been as systematical as Brad is describing it here.

Every interface can be broken down into smaller components. The concept is that the smallest component of an interface is an atom. This could be an input field, or a label for that field. Take those two atoms and they form a molecule, a small component that can be included as a single unit to the interface. Molecules can go on and form more complex components; organisms. This could be a global header for a website or a login form.

Brad also introduces PatternLab in this book, a tool that will help form this atomic approach into your own workflow for interface design. I’ve already started looking how I can incorporate this on my own. If you work with creating interfaces for the web, or anywhere else for that matter, this book is a huge help.
