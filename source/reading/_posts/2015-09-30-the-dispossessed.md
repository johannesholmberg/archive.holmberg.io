One thing is sure. Whenever I’m reading a book from Ursula Le Guin I have a lot to think about afterwards. This book was no exception and it felt like a rollercoaster for the mind.

The story circles around Shevek, a male member of the new society living on Anarres—a habitable moon to the planet Urras. 170 years earlier, a group of revolutionists left Urras in order to build up a new colony on Anarres, the colony which Shevek now is part of. The whole expedition was an experiment in setting up a new society system—where there would be no laws and no government. Now Shevek is returning to Urras, the first of the colonists to do so, and the ideological battle can begin.
