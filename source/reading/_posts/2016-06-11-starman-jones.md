Last weekend I finished another amazing story by the grandfather of science fiction. Max Jones is a runaway teenager who is looking for a way to get out in space.
{: .intro}

On his way on the road he meets Sam Andersson who's also looking for a way getting to Earthport, which functions as kind of the airport for space ships going to and leaving earth. After some initial trouble they team up as to make their chances better.

As I've mentioned numerous times before, after reading a Heinlein novel it's the evolving of his characters which appeals most to me. The way that Max grew his character during this book was amazing. And now he's kind of another of my idols that I look up to. Strange that I can get so much from a book, but that's why I fancy Mr. Heinlein so much I guess.
