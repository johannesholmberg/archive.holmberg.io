description: 'There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for oneâ€™s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions.'

<p class="intro" markdown="1">**I'm not sure** why I picked up this book to begin with. I think it was the name. I'd heard the expression, of course, and here was the book that coined it. I was quite taken by the illogicality of the sentences and dialogue. The style of this book is rather amusing.</p>
