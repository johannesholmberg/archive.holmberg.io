Back to reading another Heinlein. In this book he introduces the concept of mankind inventing tunnels through space, sort of like a gate that can transfer any material. This has made a huge impact on society and people are now emigrating throughout the galaxy in an instant.

Rod Walker, a graduate student about to take his final examination in solo survival will have to go through one of these tunnels. He and his fellow students will be dropped on a planet somewhere in the galaxy. They will have to survive for a week, without any idea of where they are. However, a catastrophic event occurs and makes them stranded indefinitely. They will have to work together to make a new living.

This book reminded me so much about _Lord of the Flies_, but in a more mature way. In that book it touched on the theme of how children will survive left to their own means. Here itâ€™s adolescents that has to find a way. To me it was so exciting to follow how they learn and form their own little society.
