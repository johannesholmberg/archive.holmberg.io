I went to an island by myself for a couple of days and wanted to have an easy read so I decided to pick up the newly released book by Haruki Murakami (well they were written in 1978/1979 but just released in English.)

It's interesting that his style was so well developed even in his first books. You can't tell them apart from anything he's written since. They have a simple, nice structure that I very much enjoyed reading for a day.
