I went to an island by myself for a couple of days and wanted to have an easy read so I decided to pick up the newly released book by Haruki Murakami (well they were written in 1978/1979 but just released in English.)
{: .intro }

It's interesting that his style was so well developed even in his first books. You can't tell them apart from anything he's written since. They have a simple, nice structure that I very much enjoyed reading for a day.
