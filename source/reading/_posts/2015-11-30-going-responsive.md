Where [Ethan's book] took care of the technological bits and pieces in creating a responsive web system, Karen's book takes a more holistic approach to the whole responsive project. It's like taking a step back and involve the rest of the people. It's not just designers and developers who needs to be aware of how to work with a responsive website, the whole organization around it needs to change.

Karen gives concrete recommendations for how to approach your content and restructure it into flexible chunks. She also provides an outstanding dictionary describing what terms around responsive actually means. It's crucial that the team has a common understanding of these terms.

This book is important for anyone involved in a responsive project on the web.
