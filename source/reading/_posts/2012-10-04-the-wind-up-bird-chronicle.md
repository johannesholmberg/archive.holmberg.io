<p class="intro" markdown="1">**After reading** [1Q84](/reading/1q84) and [Norwegian Wood](/reading/norwegian-wood) previously this year I had picked up my curiosity in Murakami's books. Next on the list was The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. This book is wild. I mean crazy style wild. It satisfied my Murakami fever for the moment and next I'm ready for something else.</p>

I took a couple of highlights.
