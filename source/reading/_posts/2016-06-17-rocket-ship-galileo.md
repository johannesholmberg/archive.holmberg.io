Iâ€™m continuing my row of Heinlein books and this time I wanted to start from the beginning. _Rocket Ship Galileo_ is his first book in the juveniles series. In some ways it was unusually immature but also expected since he wrote it very early on in his career.
{: .intro}

Doctor Cargraves is joined by 3 teenage engineers in a quest to be the first space ship to the moon. Together, they set out on building their ship and making the quest out in space.

Written in 1947, I find it fascinating about the inventiveness of so many concepts in the book that later came to be true. An interesting read with the knowledge of how the following years actually turned out.

I read it on my Kindle as usual and my highlights are below.
