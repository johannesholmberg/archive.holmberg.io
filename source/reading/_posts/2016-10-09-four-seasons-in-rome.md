I’m very much intrigued about Anthony Doerr at the moment and wanted to find out more about him. I found out that he had written this biographical novel while spending a year in Rome.

It’s like walking beside him when reading this book. I can smell the streets, see the people and hear all the background noise. That’s how well he describes his surroundings and what’s happening to him.

It was enjoyable to continue my exploration about Doerr and his world. He continues to deliver memorable descriptions and I had to make a lot of highlights from this book.
