<p class="intro" markdown="1">**This was** the other book in [Steve Jobs](/reading/steve-jobs) that was especially mentioned to have a great impact on his life. After discussing it with some of my Indian colleaguesâ€”it was clear that I had to read it. It's a great reminder of all the potential every human being has and the ability to direct this potential.</p>

These are my highlights.
