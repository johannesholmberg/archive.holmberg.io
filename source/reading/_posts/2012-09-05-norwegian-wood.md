**My second book** to read from Murakami. This is his only book which does not contain the metaphysical. It is a simple and plain love story. But it just enhances Murakamis style even more, since that is what this book is resting on. It's impressive how he can make a plain story so interesting. I guess heâ€™s really good at making his characters likeable.
