I haven’t read much Stephen King, sadly. Most of what I know from him are the film adaptions I’ve watched in my youth. I’m not sure who recommended me this book but it’s been on my reading list for quite some time. I started it over the holidays and came to like it very much.

It’s written in two parts. The first is sort of autobiographical and the second is structured with concrete tips and rules for getting better at writing. I liked the first part the most. What always grabs my fascination is finding out how people shape themselves. I learn a lot from it.

In fact I learned more from the part when Stephen describes himself growing up, the _story_ about him, than from what I did in the instructive part which was supposed to have a lot of takeaways. Funny thing that.

He taught me how to handle the tools of a trade. Keep your tools at hand, look at them from time to time, see each tool new, remind yourself of its function, and if some of them are rusty, clean them off. I believe this to be very true, but overlooked, in almost every industry.

Now that I know a bit more about Stephen King and what kind of guy he is, I would like to read some of his fiction work. So I’ve set myself the goal of reading two of his books during this year.
