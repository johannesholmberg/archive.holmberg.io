**I've** joined a book club. We had the first get together yesterday and it was a refreshing talk with kind people. The subject for the evening was this German book *The Tin Drum* about the boy Oskar who chooses to stop growing when he's three years old.

Now placed in a mental institution, Oskar recalls his life by drumming up stories on his tin drum. Set in Gdańsk at the beginning of Second World War and the years after it you follow Oskar and the encounters he makes while "growing up".

I struggled with the book quite a bit, mainly because it lacks dialog. Most books I read are usually heavy on that part. I love a dialog because it gives me the feeling that I can eavesdrop on the characters, and then it's up to me to judge who I'm siding with. But here you get the events explained to you, and from a perspective of a person placed in a mental institution; it's a real challenge to tell what is actually going on.

The last part makes up for the trembling beginning so in the end it felt rewarding to finish it, but I wouldn’t read it again. There were some funny parts throughout the book which I have highlighted here.
