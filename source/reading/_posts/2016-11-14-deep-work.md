I've heard much about this book recently. First I heard about it on several podcasts I'm listening to. Then a lot of people I admire started recommending it. For me, this year has mainly been about reading fiction on my part. But my interest for this book increased rapidly and so I focused last week on finally reading it.

Deep Work was a big eye opener. It's been incredibly motivating to read and has lots of practical tips for getting started working in a distraction free way, which will generate work of a more valuable nature. Cal Newport elegantly makes the case of why this type of work is important and why it is so rare in our market today.

As I've been reading it, I felt that this book will probably have a huge impact on the way I approach my own work. I hope this to be a skill I can cultivate with time.
