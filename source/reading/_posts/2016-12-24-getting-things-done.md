This is the book I should have read five years ago. It was a lot of buzz around it then but for some reason I never got to it. I wasn’t much into reading back then, but things have changed. The last months I’ve been reading lots of productivity books so I thought it natural to get back to this one and finally read it.

The system that David Allen proposes in the book is very simple. Get everything you have to do out of your head and into an externalized system, an external brain of sorts. There are five steps to get this system working for you:

1. _Capture_ what has our attention.
2. _Clarify_ what each item means and what to do about it.
3. _Organize_ the results.
4. _Reflect_ on the options.
5. _Engage_ with the tasks.

As I’ve been reading this, the capture phase has shown remarkable results from day one. I keep a lot of things in my head with the intention that more important tasks will grow and the less important ones will just float away. But this can get tedious. Sometimes things don’t float away, they just simmer around until my head is overfilled.

Now I capture everything that grabs my attention and put it in a system that will be reviewed the next morning. That way I can clarify what it means and decide if it’s important or not in a later stage. I can’t recommend this book enough for people who seek to be a bit more “on top of things” in their own world.
