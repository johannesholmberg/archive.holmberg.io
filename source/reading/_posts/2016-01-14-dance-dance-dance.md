I love Murakami's books. It's like a different world I can delve in to for a little while. I enjoy his ability to tell engaging stories by using nothing but the normalcy of life. Even simple acts as preparing a meal is told with such ease that I can't help but continue turning the page, or in this case, swipe onward on the Kindle.

Last week I picked up this one and it has the exact same style as the rest of his stories, the same spirit. In fact, if you've read one Murakami, you've pretty much read them all. It's just an expanding universe from the same storyteller. But that's also the point why I keep reading them. I want more of these stories, structured in this personal way.

The book is a spinoff on [A Wild Sheep Chase] so it follows the storyline from there, but it could as well be read completely separate while it doesn't depend too much on its predecessor.

My highlights from the book is below. I read the Kindle version so it's referring to location instead of page number.
