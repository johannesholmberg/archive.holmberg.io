Last week I read *[Deep Work]({{ site.url }}/reading/deep-work/)* which started my mind working to optimize my routines in a better way. It changed many things for me and upset the norms I'd fallen into. I like when books do that for me, it's a great help.

Encouraged by the way *Deep Work* forced me to tweak and change my habits I picked up another book within the same kind of topic. *Flow* has been on my reading list for almost a year and I found the timing perfect to start it now.

This book describes the way our mind forms experiences and how we can learn to adjust these formations. It offers an explanation between pleasure and enjoyment that I found very helpful. Overall this is a great book to get some better insights in how the mind works.

## Key takeaways
- Make challenges for yourself. Even a simple task can be enjoyable when you turn it into a game.
- Enjoyment leads to growing of the self.
- The joy of surpassing the limits of the body is open to all.
- A goal in itself is not important; what matters is that it focuses a person's attention and involves in it an achievable, enjoyable activity.
