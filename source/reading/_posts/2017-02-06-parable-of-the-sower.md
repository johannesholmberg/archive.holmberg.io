This is a quite unique read. The style of the writing is simple, plain and very beautiful. This is the first book I read by Octavia E. Butler and I think it’s refreshing, the way she manages to strip her sentences down to bare essence. There are almost no adverbs in the book and it makes the reading experience enjoyable.

The story is set in a dystopian future. The year is 2025 and the whole story is built up by journal entries from this village girl, Lauren Olamina. She describes how their society is breaking down bit by bit. How they need walled villages to keep out robbers and arsonists from vandalizing their communities. It’s a cruel and ugly world.

In all this despair she finds hope by slowly starting to found her own religion. She describes it as “discovering truth” and her ideas are represented by excerpts from poetry she writes.

I found out there is a sequel to this book, I’m looking forward to read it and find out more about how Lauren is maturing her ideas.
