This is a short book. Very concise and to the point. Abby is going through the tools available for organizing any given thing. She gave me some new insights and techniques that I would like to try out.

For instance – create a list of words that you never should use in writing. That’s a great idea. Like a personal manual for your own prose.

There was also an extensive collection of all types of diagrams that could be used to sort out information. I should definitely practice this more so I’m comfortable in choosing the right tool for the job.
