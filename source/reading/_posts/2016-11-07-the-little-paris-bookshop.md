I have spent the last few weeks being astonished by _The Little Paris Bookshop_. The whole set up is just brilliant. Monsieur Jean Perdu is a traditional bookseller but has a very special gift—the ability to know what books will cure his customers mental “illnesses”.

He learns what his customers want from a book and sell it as if it were medicine. His store is called the literary apothecary and is actually a barge moored on the Seine in Paris.

I didn’t know a thing about this book when I started it. Right from the beginning I was positively surprised by the poetic lines and the natural flow of dialog. There were places where the story unfolded in such a heartbreaking way that I literally couldn’t read further, I had to take a break and think it through.

The book filled me with contemplation and a new found desire for adventure.
