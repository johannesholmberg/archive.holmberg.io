The first paperback I’ve read in years. It’s the story about Bruno Manser, the Swiss shepherd who in 1984 trekked through the rainforests of Borneo to live with the people of Penan.

In six years Bruno saw the destruction of the rainforest by the Malaysian government. He swore to do all he could to stop it so he started campaign after campaign against it. After being Malaysia’s enemy number one, he disappeared in the rainforest in 2000.

I love personal books because it gives me a deep picture of another person. I learn so much by that. The writing was a bit up and down and it definitely had its weak spots. Especially describing the politics between logging companies and the Malaysian government. But I loved the part describing how Bruno learned to live in the forest and his experiences there. It’s got a tragic end with his disappearance and even I, who had no involvement with his life whatsoever, has a knot in my stomach and wonder what happened to him.
