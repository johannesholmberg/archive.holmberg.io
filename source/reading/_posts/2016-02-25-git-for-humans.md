Git is hard. And it can be a bit messy at times. But it is an essential tool in the modern workflow and I couldn't live without it. When you grasp it, it is just so powerful. This is what David's book helps you do, grasp it.

It's written in very plain and easy going language. That's refreshing for a book which handles a technical subject. I learned a few new neat tricks and rules that I will incorporate in my own workflow from now on.
