Second time I’m reading _Breakfast of Champions_ now. The first time was back in 2012 and I was really into Kurt Vonnegut then. I liked his style and his satirical tone.

The reason why I started reading it again was that it was the subject of the month for the book club I’m attending.

It’s hard to describe what the book’s story actually is about. I think it’s best to use Vonnegut’s own words to give a short description: “It is the story of two lonesome, skinny, fairly old white men on a planet which was dying fast.”

The funny thing is that I didn’t find it as amusing this time around. It definitely didn’t hold up for a second reading and now I’m happy to move on to something more engaging to read.
