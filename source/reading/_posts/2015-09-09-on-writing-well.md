This book has been on my reading list for a long time. Writing is important to me and I want to make it a more integrated part of my life. By writing I'm learning. The book goes through different forms of writing, how to choose your words to make the right job and how to think about the audience.

About one year ago I read another book on writing that’s called *[Bird by Bird]({{site.url}}/reading/bird-by-bird/)* by Anne Lamott. While *Bird by Bird* is great–it’s written with another goal and in another style. I can feel the author takes my hand, pat me on my back and say “You can do this”, while this book is more focused on the actual writing itself.

William Zinsser was a master at his craft and I admire him for the simple way he can construct a sentence and yet make it feel so alive. A lot in this book is about teaching just that. Bring the person, the author, into the writing and make your audience feel they're listening to a real human, not a machine.

Writing is hard. Especially writing well. Now I have some guidance and hope it will help me a bit in expressing myself. It would be great to pick up this book once every year to keep it fresh. I’ll try that.
