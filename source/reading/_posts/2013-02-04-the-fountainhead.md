<p class="intro" markdown="1">**The Fountainhead** is probably my favorite book in life. I've read it several times by now and I feel like I'm a refreshed person every time. When I face difficulties, I think about Howard and how he would reason in a situation like mine. It's a book ([with](/reading/stranger-in-a-strange-land) a [couple](/reading/island) of [others](/reading/atlas-shrugged/)) that helped me shape my own view of the world when I needed it most.</p>

I don't think any other of the books I've read has this many highlights. Iâ€™m up to 86 (and still counting...)
