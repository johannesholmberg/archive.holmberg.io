I’ve set a personal goal to read 4 books on productivity this year. _The Checklist Manifesto_ is the first one out. This book grabbed my attention after hearing it mentioned in a podcast I listen to, [Canvas]. Then it was referenced again in an article I read so I put it on my reading list.

Atul Gawande makes the case for how simple checklists can improve our lives. We reach a certain level where it’s not our lack of knowledge that sets us up for failure. It’s rather the human fallibility. Things will be forgotten, no matter how trivial they may seem. He describes how he wanted to make his hospital, where he works as a doctor, safer and more protected against errors. He looked to the engineering industry and the aviation business. He found that that they both use checklists to avoid simple, human mistakes.

Checklists are powerful. I’ve set up a few personal checklists of my own lately to help me be more systematic. I have a checklist I go through before leaving my home when going on a vacation for instance. It alleviates my mind from all the things I have to do before I leave. Close all windows, water the plants, turn off alarms, turn off computers etc. I reference to the list, go through it and be done with it.
