After reading a couple of down to earth books in German I wanted to break it off with some good old science fiction. In plain English. I've been interesting in Arthur Clarkeâ€™s work for a while and I like many of his quotes. But I never actually gotten around to read any of his books, such a shame. I'm very hooked on this theme that Isaac Asimov framed as "social science fiction".

So I looked around a bit and found The Songs of Distant Earth. The story is set on Thalassa, which located in another solar system is a planet mostly consisting of oceans. Its few islands have now been colonized by humans. Unsuspectingly, Thalassa receives a visit from a spaceship. It turns out to be humans from earth on their way to colonize yet another planet, in another solar system. But they need something before they go on.

This was just the book from me. An interesting story with a great philosophical theme. I read it on the Kindle as usual.
