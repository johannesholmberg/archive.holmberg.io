<p class="intro" markdown="1">**I first got** to know about Musk last autumn when colleagues of mine were deep into discussions about Tesla and how it radically was changing the automotive industry. I hadn’t really heard about him before but since then, I’ve seen him in magazines, in [TEDx talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKWPdJWuBQ) and the Internet is basically on this chronic buzz about what Musk may do next. I wanted to know him better so I bought this book.</p>

I’m a [huge](/reading/stranger-in-a-strange-land) [fan](/reading/farmer-in-the-sky) of [Robert](/reading/time-enough-for-love) [Heinlein](/reading/revolt-in-2100), so it makes me so happy and full of excitement when I read that basically a lot of what Musk is doing is to fulfill Heinleins philosophy of what mankind may be in the future. He's taking science fiction and making it real. That's a great ideal to strive for.

These are my highlights from the book.
