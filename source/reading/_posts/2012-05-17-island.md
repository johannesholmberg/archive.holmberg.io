**Island was another book** I picked out from a [Lost reference](http://coyotemercury.com/2007/03/21/the-lost-book-club-stranger-in-a-strange-land/). I see this book as one of the starting points that got me interested in minimalism. [Aldous Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley) brings up many topics in this book about a regular westerner exploring the distant and unknown island Pala. With the book he is questioning human society and how it functions today by showing how different it actually could be.

It started me questioning my own behavior and I took away a lot of great highlights from this book.
