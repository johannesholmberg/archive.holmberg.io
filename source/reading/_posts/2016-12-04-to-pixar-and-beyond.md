Wow. What I learned in this book was astonishing. I picked it up on the premise that it conveyed yet another view of Steve Jobs. Written this time on the perspective from Pixar. But learning some more about Steve is just a side track. The real learnings from this book is about the history of Pixar and the business decisions taken that made it what it is today.

It's written from an incredibly human perspective. The author, Lawrence Levy, writes with such a personal tone and humble undertaking. He describes how uncertain he was at joining Pixar as CFO in 1994 when Steve Jobs called him and asked if he wanted to be on the team. How he later had to dig around to find what could make Pixar into a business.

He eloquently tells how the box office and the film industry works, how an IPO (a company going public) is being realized, how Pixar's relations to Disney was at the beginning. And it feels as if you're sitting next to him as he slowly takes you through all these complicated matters with such ease.

## Key takeaways
- _Toy Story_ needed to make at least $50 million in the domestic box office to turn Pixar into a sustainable company.
- The seventeen animated feature films that came before _Toy Story_, excluding Disney blockbusters, had made an average of $14 million.
- The top animated feature films of all time who had made over a $100 million was _Aladdin_, _The Lion King_, _Beauty and the Beast_, and _Pocahontas_.
- _Toy Story_ eventually ended up earning $192 million in the domestic box office and became the most successful film of 1995.
