I've never read Virginia Woolf before so I decided to pick one up on this summer vacation.
{: .intro}

I haven't read anything quite like her style before. She uses a style of writing called "the stream of consciousness". The plot is neither deep nor full of actions. It barely happens a thing of interest. The story rather develops inside the head of the characters and their thoughts about each other and life in general.

It was a bit hard to get into at first but I liked it more and more. The poetic style is beautiful and it hit the spot for me several times.
