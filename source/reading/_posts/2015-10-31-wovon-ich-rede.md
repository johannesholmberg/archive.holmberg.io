The second book I read in October as part of my [learning German project]. This is Murakami’s most personal book and could be claimed as his autobiography where he describes his life balancing writing novels with running. It’s fascinating to follow along as he is preparing for another marathon or a triathlon (he’s made one every year since 1983).

The book gave me great insight to one of my favorite authors life as well as it helped me gain more skills in German. I read the Kindle version and below are my highlights.
