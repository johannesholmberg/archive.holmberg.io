This was the book chosen for my book club's meeting in April. *The Player of Games* is a science fiction novel written by Iain M. Banks in the late 80's.
{: .intro}

Jernau Gurgeh has devoted his life to studying and playing board games. Bored with his successful life, he is offered to travel to the Empire of Azad and play a highly complicated type of game. Something quite unlike anything he faced before.

This was a very unique story to me and I enjoyed reading it very much. The characterization of Jernau was well detailed and I liked to follow his thought patterns as he described his actions and thinking throughout the games.
