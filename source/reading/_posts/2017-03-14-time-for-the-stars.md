In _Time for the Stars_, Robert Heinlein tells the story of the first survey ships going out into space looking for suitable planets for humanity to colonize. The problem with the mission is that a regular communication system with Earth would be too inefficient. Sent messages would take years to reach their destination and valuable information would be irretrievably lost.

An independent organization starts doing experiment with identical twins and find out that they have some form of telekinetic abilities. It would mean that they can “talk” to each other instantly. The only problem is that one of each pair has to stay home…

It was the first Heinlein that I listened to as an audio book and it was as exciting as ever. He has so many interesting themes that he’s exploring in his books and he always knows how to cook up a good story.
