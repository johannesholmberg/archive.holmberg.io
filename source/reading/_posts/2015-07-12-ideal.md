<p class="intro" markdown="1">**It was a long time** since I last read anything from Ayn Rand, but she is still considered one of my favorite authors. I was thrilled when I heard they were releasing some of her earlier unpublished writing. Ideal was originally published as a play but this book contains both the novel and the play in the same edition.</p>

It's clearly not her best story and the style is a bit unpolished, but you can still see the initial spark of what would later lead to [her](/reading/atlas-shrugged) [masterpieces](/reading/the-fountainhead).

I didn't do so much highlighting but the few I did clearly shows the style that only Ayn Rand can produce.
