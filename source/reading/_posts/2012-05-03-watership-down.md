**I loved** the [TV-show Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)) and think it's among the best series ever produced. What's great about it is that they have a lot of subtle book references here and there, so whenever I don't know what to read next—I check out what's been referenced. That’s how I stumbled on Watership Down.

Watership Down is an adventure story essentially for kids but it still entertained me and I got a couple of good highlights.
