This is another of those historical fiction books that I enjoy to read so much. The story is about Hadley Richardson who in the 20’s meet Ernest Hemingway. It describes how they find each other in Chicago and set off to Paris together.

I liked the book a lot even if it was sad to find out about Ernest’s declining transformation in the later part. The book is written from Hadley’s perspective and it’s almost as if you’re sitting at the table with her when reading it. You can feel the cigarette smoke, see the clothes people wear and be part of it all. I felt like I was moved to the atmosphere of Paris in the 20’s.

Other famous characters also appear in the book like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein. It was interesting to get a feel for those people as well.
