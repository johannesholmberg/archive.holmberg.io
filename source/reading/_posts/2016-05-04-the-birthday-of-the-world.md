A short story collection by one of my favorite science fiction writer Ursula Le Guin. It's been fascinating to get involved deeper in her amazing societies. While her novels usually has a main plot and the worlds themselves are the background to that story, now she instead brings up the backgrounds in the light which is really interesting to a fan like me.
