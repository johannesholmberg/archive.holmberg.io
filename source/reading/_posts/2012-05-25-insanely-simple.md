intro: 'To settle for second best is a violation of the rules of Simplicity, and it plants the seeds for disappointment, extra work, and more meetings. Most disturbing, it puts you in the worst possible business position: having to defend an idea you never believed in.'

<p class="intro" markdown="1">**There was a lot** of books about Steve Jobs during this time and I was interested in the topic so I picked up this one as well. It's written by Ken Segall who used to work for Chiat/Day, the agency Apple hired for the marketing of their products.</p>

He has a lot of good points.
