I got a great deal of book recommendations from _[Tools of Titans]_ (my reading list on Goodreads is overflowing at the moment...) One of them was _On the Shortness of Life_ by the Stoic philosopher Seneca, born 4 years B.C and died in 65 AD.

It was a very easy read, which surprised me since the writing is almost 2000 years old. It’s a short book just over 100 pages containing a philosophical essay on how wasteful we are of time. It was fascinating how much I could relate to it, it’s a timeless piece that I will reread many times over.
