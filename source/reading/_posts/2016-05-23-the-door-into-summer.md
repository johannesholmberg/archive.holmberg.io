It was such a relief to finally be able to pick up another book by Robert Heinlein. The sad thing about reading his books is that as quickly as you finishâ€”you wish you had it unread. That's how good they are.
{: .intro}

The Door into Summer follows Daniel Boone Davis, an engineer and inventor who can't stop making up new gadgets and machines that will be able to do more of the gruesome household work in a more autonomous way.

A very interesting story that covers time travel, engineering problems and a view of how the year 2000 would look from 1957 when the book first was written.
