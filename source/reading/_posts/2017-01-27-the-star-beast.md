Heinlein fascinates me. How could he turn out so many different stories in such a short time? Even books that sounds a tiny bit silly from the description, like this one, turns out to have philosophical themes and a compelling story. I would like to read everything Mr. Heinlein ever has written and this was another step towards that.

_The Star Beast_, book number 8 in his Juvenile’s series circles around Lummox. A large alien pet belonging to John Thomas which has been in the Stuart family for generations. It turns out that Lummox is much more than meets the eye. From _her_ perspective she is the one who has been _rasing_ “John Thomas’es” for the last few hundred years…

This is not one of Heinlein’s best but I’m still happy to have read it. I take away quite a few interesting concepts from it.
