David Winkler grows up with his mom in the town of Anchorage, Alaska. He is fascinated by snow and the weather. As he gets older he starts having dreams which turns out to happen in reality. The biggest question in the book, and for Winkler himself, is if he has the ability to change the outcomes of his dreams or if time itself is already set in its course. A question that really come to test when in one of his dreams he sees the death of his daughter...

As I've been reading *About Grace*, the book has managed to stay with me. I've been thinking a lot about Winkler's horrible dilemma, how he handled the situation and how he moved on with his life. What I always find fascinating with books is how they can describe people, life and routines from so many different locations in the world. I learn much from that.

I got to know how Winkler dealed with his surroundings in the most freezing part of Alaska as well as in the tropical heat on St. Vincent, a remote Caribbean island. The book has a slow paced, almost poetic style and it works so well for me. It lets me breath, and think.

I regard this book dearly and Anthony Doerr has quickly become one of my favorite authors. Earlier this year I read *[All the Light We Cannot See]* which also had a beautiful story with memorable characters.
