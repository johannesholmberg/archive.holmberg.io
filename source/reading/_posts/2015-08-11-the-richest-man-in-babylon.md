I was recommended this book by my friend [Ramon](https://plus.google.com/100342454906627581348/posts). I like when teaching comes in the form of a story. It makes it stick. As in this case—financial teaching—comes in the form of various stories set in the ancient Babylon. The most important lesson is that a 10th of what I earn is mine to keep and should be made to generate future income.
