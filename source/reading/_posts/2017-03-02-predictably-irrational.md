This was my second audio book to finish this year. It contained a lot of interesting facts and small anecdotes about how irrational we humans behave. I found it harder though to get back to this book than when i listened to _[Hearts in Atlantis]_. Probably because it’s not fiction and then I wasn’t as invested in the story.

When I’ve been out walking I didn’t have the same joy to put my earbuds in and continue the book. I guess it’s easier for me to listen to fiction as audio books, and preferably read books of fact on paper or on the Kindle. I will use that as a rule going forward.
