**The reason** I first picked up [Stranger in a Strange Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land) was because it was a [Lost reference](http://coyotemercury.com/2007/03/21/the-lost-book-club-stranger-in-a-strange-land/). This started my bond with [Robert Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein). What is so magical about his books is that they're not just thrilling and well structured from a fiction point of view, they also contain so much political philosophy. This book got me started exploring my own worldview. It was also the book that gave birth to the word [‘grok’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) which made it into the English dictionary.
