**Three years** after picking up [Walter Isaacsons book](/reading/steve-jobs) (the one that got me back in to reading regularly), I'd accumulated some more hunger for a deeper understanding of Jobs.

Instead of just giving a flat timeline of events, this book is different from the official biography in how it's connecting the dots from Jobs earlier life and shows how those experiences transformed him into becoming the business leader as we remember him today. It paints a more humane picture of Jobs.
