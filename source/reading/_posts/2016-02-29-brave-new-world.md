There's been two books on my reading list for years. _Brave New World_ and _1984_. Two classics covering the same theme that I never got around to read. This weekend as I was on a trip to Edinburgh I finally decided to open up _Brave New World_.

Aldous Huxley's _[Island]_ is one of my favorite books and I think that is a reason why I haven't read this until now. _Island_ was Huxley's utopia, his answer to the dystopian _Brave New World_. I was not sure I would get anything out of this. But I was of course very wrong.

What Huxley depicts in this book is that humans would be enslaved by their own comfort. That a totalitarian state would use pleasure as a forcing rule. People aren't born anymore but instead “hatched” and conditioned from the very start by thought patterns conducted by the state. People think what the state wants them to think. And if anything goes wrong or anyone starts acting too “free minded”, there is always _soma_, a drug that comfortably takes away all your anxieties without the slightest side effect.

It's a very interesting topic in today's society where I can draw a lot of parallels to the comfortable life of some of the characters in the book.

I'm thrilled to pick up _1984_ next. It's going to be a complete different view of the totalitarian state.
