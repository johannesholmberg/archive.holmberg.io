A brief book by Anna Debenham on the topic of style guides for front-end development. It’s a topic dear to my heart and since I’ve started using PatternLab recently, this book was a great complement to why style guides are so important.

She argues well why a systematic design approach is to prefer, instead of redesigning “pages” every time new requirments come up. If we design a collection of components, they could almost always be reused or further enhanced to accommodate new use cases.

There’s also a whole topic on tools for creating automatic style guides. There were a few new personal discoveries that I will have a look through. This is a great book if you’re looking to learn how to create, and maintain, style guides for a web project.
