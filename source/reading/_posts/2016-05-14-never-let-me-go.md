I got this book from a friend a couple of weeks ago and have been savoring it since. The story circles around Kathy H, who is writing to us in the form of a memoir.
{: .intro}

It's clear quite early that she is reminiscing about her younger age when she was a student at a place called Hailsham, she is telling about her friends, about small details and situations that made them turn out the way they did.

At the beginning it feels like a plain love story that's being retold from a more experienced point of view.

But there are those small curious hints which progressively reveals a much deeper nature of the story. It was tastefully done and always kept me reading because I wanted to figure out what was wrong with these students.

And it turned out to be much more dramatic than I ever thought it could be from judging by its cover.
