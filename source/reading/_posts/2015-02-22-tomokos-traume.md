<p class="intro" markdown="1">**My very first** book I read in German. It was fun to complete a whole book in a new foreign language. It was a perfect start, it was simply written, and now I hope to be able to read some more books in German.</p>

I didn’t do to much highlighting because the story was pretty plain and I didn’t find any specific parts I liked. Just saved the last sentence from the book:
