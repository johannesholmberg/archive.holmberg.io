I think I found this book through a recommendation on Amazon. It’s built up by a set of interviews and key take aways from each person. I read _The 4-Hour Workweek_ many years ago but I was not crazy about it. This one I liked. It’s got a lot of meaty information and you can read it in any way you want. Just pick up from any chapter and there will be something interesting to try out in your life.

I like it because of the same way I like _[Daily Rituals]_. I get insights in to how interesting people structure their lives. I can cherry pick techniques from these people to incorporate on my own. Highly recommended.
