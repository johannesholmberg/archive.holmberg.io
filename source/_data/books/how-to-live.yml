- quote: "Having been guided early in life by his own curiosity alone, he grew up to be an independent-minded adult, following his own path in everything rather than deferring to duty and discipline – an outcome perhaps more far-reaching than his father had bargained for."
  loc: 1114

- quote: "Montaigne also loved the strong sense of Plutarch’s own personality that comes across in his work: ‘I think I know him even into his soul.’ This was what Montaigne looked for in a book, just as people later looked for it in him: the feeling of meeting a real person across the centuries. "
  loc: 1309

- quote: "Montaigne’s merging of favourite authors with his own father says a lot about how he read: he took up books as if they were people, and welcomed them into his family. "
  loc: 1314

- quote: "‘Forget much of what you learn’ and ‘Be slow-witted’ became two of Montaigne’s best answers to the question of how to live. They freed him to think wisely rather than glibly; they allowed him to avoid the fanatical notions and foolish deceptions that ensnared other people; and they let him follow his own thoughts wherever they led – which was all he really wanted to do. "
  loc: 1422

- quote: "He agreed that the most important thing in confronting political abuse was to maintain one’s mental freedom – and that could mean opting out of public life rather than engaging with it. "
  loc: 1832

- quote: "He also wrote in the Essays about how he longed for a true companion in Italy – someone whose ways harmonised with his own, and who liked to do the things he liked to do. ‘I have missed such a man extremely on all my travels.’ "
  loc: 2005

- quote: "If you feel tired of everything you possess, suggests Plutarch, pretend that you have lost all these things and are missing them desperately. "
  loc: 2087

- quote: "Some of his answers to the question of how to live are indeed chilly: mind your own business, preserve your sense of self, stay out of trouble and keep your room behind the shop. "
  loc: 3089

- quote: "On a global scale, no single creature can be of much importance, he wrote, yet in another way these ‘I’s are the only things of importance. And only a politics that recognises them can offer hope for the future. "
  loc: 3292

- quote: "Astrologers now warn of ‘great and imminent alterations and mutations’, writes Montaigne, but they forget the simple fact that, however bad things are, most of life goes on undisturbed. ‘I do not despair about it,’ he added lightly. "
  loc: 3803

- quote: "Montaigne did celebrate being Montaigne. "
  loc: 3934

- quote: "I turn my gaze inward, I fix it there and keep it busy. Everyone looks in front of him; as for me, I look inside of me; I have no business but with myself; I continually observe myself, I take stock of myself, I taste myself … I roll about in myself. "
  loc: 3947

- quote: "THE SUCCESS OF Montaigne’s first edition of the Essays in 1580 must have changed his way of thinking about life. The acclaim knocked him out of his routine, and perhaps gave him the feeling that it was time to engage with the world again. "
  loc: 3990

- quote: "What he loved above all about his travels was the feeling of going with the flow. He avoided all fixed plans. ‘If it looks ugly on the right, I take the left; if I find myself unfit to ride my horse, I stop.’ "
  loc: 4048

- quote: "In fact, modern Rome had been formed by a similar process to the one Montaigne used to write his Essays. Ceaselessly adding quotations and allusions, he recycled his classical reading as the Romans recycled their stone. The similarity seems to have occurred to him, and he once called his book a building assembled from the spoils of Seneca and Plutarch. "
  loc: 4223

- quote: "People involve themselves because they want to have an air of consequence, or to advance their private interests, or simply to keep busy so that they don’t have to think about life. "
  loc: 4360

- quote: "It is not really difficult to get on when caught between two hostile parties, he wrote; all you have to do is to behave with a temperate affection towards both, so that neither thinks he owns you. Don’t expect too much of them, and don’t offer too much either. One could sum up Montaigne’s policy by saying that one should do a good job, but not too good a job. "
  loc: 4382

- quote: "Montaigne knew that some of the things he had done in the past no longer made sense to him, but he was content to presume that he must have been a different person at the time, and leave it at that. His past selves were as diverse as a group of people at a party. Just as he would not think of passing judgement on a roomful of acquaintances, all of whom had their own reasons and points of view to explain what they had done, so he would not think of judging previous versions of Montaigne. "
  loc: 4989

- quote: "But Gournay’s feminism remained closely tied to her ‘Montaignism’. Her belief that men and women were equal – neither being superior to the other, though different in experience and situation – was in tune with his relativism. "
  loc: 5211

- quote: "By understanding that age does not make one wise, one attains a kind of wisdom after all. "
