- quote: "Think about this example: You are a shareholder for a medical technology company. At the annual shareholder meeting that you attend one of the speakers shows a list of the medical products the company makes and says “Our medical products have helped hundreds of patients around the world.” Now think about this example: The same presenter shows a picture of a smiling 45-year-old woman walking on a city street and says “Marianne Winter had such severe lumbar scoliosis that the pain incapacitated her and the deformity was progressively getting worse. Then she underwent spinal fusion surgery using our spinal products to correct the alignment. Today Marianne’s spine is much straighter her pain is virtually gone and she is several inches taller.” It’s a serious topic but a story makes the point much stronger."
