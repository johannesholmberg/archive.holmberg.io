Ask Clevinger.” “Clevinger? Where is Clevinger? You find Clevinger and I’ll ask him.” “Then ask any of the others. They’ll tell you how crazy I am.” “They’re crazy.” “Then why don’t you ground them?” “Why don’t they ask me to ground them?” “Because they’re crazy, that’s why.” “Of course they’re crazy,” Doc Daneeka replied. “I just told you they’re crazy, didn’t I? And you can’t let crazy people decide whether you’re crazy or not, can you?“"

Major Major’s father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa."
