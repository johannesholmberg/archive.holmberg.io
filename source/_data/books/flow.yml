- quote: "In the meantime, those who seek consolation in existing churches often pay for their peace of mind with a tacit agreement to ignore a great deal of what is known about the way the world works."
  loc: 426

- quote: "The answer seems clear: while humankind collectively has increased its material powers a thousandfold, it has not advanced very far in terms of improving the content of experience."
  loc: 460

- quote: "Some people produce more than the usual amount of androgens and therefore become excessively aggressive. Does that mean they should freely express violence? We cannot deny the facts of nature, but we should certainly try to improve on them."

- quote: "A thoroughly socialized person is one who desires only the rewards that others around him have agreed he should long for—rewards often grafted onto genetically programmed desires."
  loc: 519

- quote: "He may encounter thousands of potentially fulfilling experiences, but he fails to notice them because they are not the things he desires. What matters is not what he has now, but what he might obtain if he does as others want him to do."
  loc: 521

  loc: 605

- quote: "A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening “outside,” just by changing the contents of consciousness."
  loc: 626

- quote: "The events that constitute consciousness—the “things” we see, feel, think, and desire—are information that we can manipulate and use. Thus we might think of consciousness as intentionally ordered information."
  loc: 670

- quote: "Since for us outside events do not exist unless we are aware of them, consciousness corresponds to subjectively experienced reality. While everything we feel, smell, hear, or remember is potentially a candidate for entering consciousness, the experiences that actually do become part of it are much fewer than those left out."
  loc: 673

- quote: "Attention shapes the self, and is in turn shaped by it."
  loc: 838

  loc: 1053

- quote: "Pleasure helps to maintain order, but by itself cannot create new order in consciousness."
  loc: 1061

- quote: "Playing a close game of tennis that stretches one’s ability is enjoyable, as is reading a book that reveals things in a new light, as is having a conversation that leads us to express ideas we didn’t know we had."
  loc: 1066

- quote: "To gain personal control over the quality of experience, however, one needs to learn how to build enjoyment into what happens day in, day out."
  loc: 1101

- quote: "Reading is an activity because it requires the concentration of attention and has a goal, and to do it one must know the rules of written language. The skills involved in reading include not only literacy but also the ability to translate words into images, to empathize with fictional characters, to recognize historical and cultural contexts, to anticipate turns of the plot, to criticize and evaluate the author’s style, and so on."

  loc: 2117

- quote: "However, enjoyment, as we have seen, does not depend on what you do, but rather on how you do it."
  loc: 2119

- quote: "As with anything else, to enjoy music one must pay attention to it. To the extent that recording technology makes music too accessible, and therefore taken for granted, it can reduce our ability to derive enjoyment from it."

  loc: 2728

- quote: "In today’s world we have come to neglect the habit of writing because so many other media of communication have taken its place. Telephones and tape recorders, computers and fax machines are more efficient in conveying news. If the only point to writing were to transmit information, then it would deserve to become obsolete. But the point of writing is to create information, not simply to pass it along."
  loc: 2764

- quote: "The kind of material we write in diaries and letters does not exist before it is written down. It is the slow, organically growing process of thought involved in writing that lets the ideas emerge in the first place."
  loc: 2769

- quote: "Observing, recording, and preserving the memory of both the large and small events of life is one of the oldest and most satisfying ways to bring order to consciousness."
  loc: 2788

- quote: "If flow, rather than success and recognition, is the measure by which to judge its value, science can contribute immensely to the quality of life."
  loc: 2907

On the other hand, if solitude is seen as a condition to be avoided at all costs instead of as a challenge, the person will panic and resort to distractions that cannot lead to higher levels of complexity."

  loc: 4295

- quote: "The process of discovering new goals in life is in many respects similar to that by which an artist goes about creating an original work of art."
  loc: 4299

  loc: 4465

- quote: "The meaning of life is meaning: whatever it is, wherever it comes from, a unified purpose is what gives meaning to life."
  loc: 4476
