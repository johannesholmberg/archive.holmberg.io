- quote: "Perception as such, the sheer animal capacity, consists merely in staring at concretes, at a multiplicity of them, in no order, with no context, no proof, no understanding—and all one can know by this means is whatever he is staring at, as long as he is staring. Conception, however—the distinctively human faculty—involves the formation of abstractions that reduce the multiplicity to an intelligible unity. This process requires a definite order, a specific context at each stage, and the methodical use of logic. "

- quote: "The method of phonics, the old-fashioned approach, first teaches a child the sound of individual letters; then it teaches him to read words by combining these sounds. Each letter thus represents an abstraction subsuming countless instances. Once a child knows that p sounds “puh,” for instance, that becomes a principle; he grasps that every p he meets sounds the same way. When he has learned a few dozen such abstractions, he has acquired the knowledge necessary to decipher virtually any new word he encounters. Thus the gigantic multiplicity of the English vocabulary is reduced to a handful of symbols. This is the conceptual method of learning to read. "

- quote: "I must add that the look-say educators demand that children—I quote another devotee—“receive praise for a good guess even though it is not completely accurate. For example, if a child reads ‘I like to eat carrots’ as ‘I like to eat cake,’ praise should be given for supplying a word that makes sense and follows at least some of the phonic cues.” "

- quote: "Our students should not have to be concerned about factual accuracy. They need have no idea whether gases expand or contract under pressure, or whether typhus germs cause or cure disease—but this will leave them free to be “vital” and “creative.” But, you may ask, what if a student comes out in class with a wrong answer to a factual question? You are old-fashioned. There is no such answer, and besides it would be bad for the student’s psychology if there were: “How many times will a student try to respond to a question if continually told that his or her answers are wrong? Wrong answers should be reserved for quiz shows on television.”17 "

They no longer deliver prepared material while the students listen attentively and take notes. Instead, what one encounters everywhere is group-talking, that is, class participation and class discussion. "
  loc: 285

- quote: "All the arguments offered to defend this anti-teaching approach are senseless. “Students,” I have heard it said, “should develop initiative; they should discover knowledge on their own, not be spoon-fed by the teachers.” Then why should they go to school at all? Schooling is a process in which an expert is paid to impart his superior knowledge to ignorant beginners. How can this involve shelving the expert and leaving the ignorant to shift for themselves? What would you think of a doctor who told a patient to cure himself because the doctor opposed spoon-feeding? "
  loc: 293

- quote: "In the class discussions I saw, the students were regularly asked to state their own opinion. They were asked it in regard to issues about which they had no idea how to have an opinion, since they had no knowledge of the relevant facts or principles, and no knowledge of the methods of logical argument. Most of the time the students were honest; they had no opinion, in the sense of a sincere, even if mistaken, conviction on the question at hand. But they knew that they were expected to “express themselves.” Time and again, therefore, I heard the following: “I like (or dislike) X.” “Why?” “Because I do. That’s my opinion.” Whereupon the teacher would nod and say “very interesting” or “good point.” "
  loc: 314

- quote: "According to John Dewey, students are bored by lectures, but motivated to learn by collective “doing.” Not the ones I saw. Virtually every class was in continuous turmoil, created by students waving their hands to speak, dropping books, giggling, calling out remarks, whispering asides, yawning, fidgeting, shifting, shuffling. The dominant emotion was a painful boredom, which is the sign of minds being mercilessly starved and stunted. Perhaps this explains the magic influence of the bell. The instant it rang, everywhere I went, the room was empty, as though helpless victims were running for their lives from a dread plague. And so in a sense they were. "

That is why I subscribe to the philosophy of Ayn Rand. "

If you let a child loose in the jungle, he would undoubtedly learn a fair amount of information, the way wolf-boys do, but it would be scattered, disorganized concretes. That is not education. Education is a long-term, organized process. The term systematic stresses the distinction between a specific concrete skill or item of information on the one hand and education in general, on the other. "
  loc: 454

- quote: "If you are a parent, this material is crucial because parents are the ones responsible for their child’s maturation. You cannot just accept what the teacher says, particularly today. You have to know: Are they equipping my child properly or are they harming him? Are they giving him the essentials he needs to develop properly? What are the essentials? If he is having trouble in school, is that his problem or is that the fault of the school? What are the schools doing, and is that what they should be doing? A philosophy of education, in short, is essential to being a proper parent; otherwise, you are merely turning your child over to blind chance. "
  loc: 498

- quote: "A proper theory of education, like a proper theory of ethics, must tell you specifically how to function on earth. It cannot be just ambiguous, floating abstractions.

Everybody acknowledges that much, but not everybody knows the other side: you cannot teach method by itself, either. Never, not at any point from grade zero to grade twenty-five. Method requires knowledge. "
  loc: 619

- quote: "To train in method is nothing more than to present content in a certain way. It is a false alternative to distinguish between content and method, or factual information and mind training. Factual knowledge is the focus on reality. You give the child awareness of what is out there. Mind training is the intellectual process—and that is reason. So this alternative comes down to: “Should we give the child reality or should we give him reason?” That is a hopeless dichotomy. Reason is your means of knowing reality: if you divorce the two, you do not know reality and you are not reasonable. "
  loc: 625

- quote: "The intrinsic theory of cognition holds that all we have to do to acquire knowledge is simply let reality act on us. It is not necessary to focus on our minds, our consciousness, our cognitive faculty, our reason—that is irrelevant. We just have to open our minds and something out there in reality will act on us and produce knowledge as we passively sit back and wait. "
  loc: 631

- quote: "The subjective school, on the other hand, holds that we should focus on the development of our consciousness apart from worrying about reality. What really counts is consciousness, not existence. The idea is that you can train or develop your mental processes by themselves, apart from reference to the data of reality. Consciousness doesn’t need existence: it is a self-contained world we can develop. "

  loc: 677

- quote: "Concept formation is the human method of cognition. It is a way of organizing content. In the very word “concept,” you see the false dichotomy between facts and method. Concepts are organizations of data. They are ways of storing or integrating factual data. Take the word “table,” which is a concept. It is a mental symbol that enables you to hold in one mental frame all the tables around the world. There are no concepts without data and no thinking without an abundance of material content. "
  loc: 684

- quote: "Education is the systematic training of the conceptual faculty of the young, by means of supplying, in essentials, both its content and method. The purpose of education is to take a perceptual-level creature, and train him across many years, so that he emerges a mature, cognitively self-sufficient, informed being. And that is the principle that dictates both the curriculum and the instructional method. "

It communicates to the child: you are going to develop your abilities and your capacity to stand on your own and to judge independently, in contrast to “Learn this because society demands it,” or “because you will fit in better with the group,” or “because everybody’s doing it,” or “because I say so.” "
  loc: 762

I would slow down the presentation and tell the class in appropriately simple language, “You deal with people all the time. Sometimes they disappoint you. You have to learn to figure them out, to judge which ones are good and which are bad. Can you get any clues from some traits that will help you predict others?” Or I would say, “You are growing up and deciding what kind of person you are going to be. Wouldn’t it be useful to have an indication of all the different types of human beings, like a menu at a restaurant? That is really what literature is. It is like a menu of the kinds of human beings, what to expect from them and an exercise in seeing if one trait leads to another.” "

You simply have to learn the technique of acting as though you are delivering the material for the first time and are relishing it. It is important to remember that this is just a secondary factor. If you present something in the most excited manner, but the class has no idea why, they will be baffled. In every case, you must first lay down the actual reasons for the subject. "

I bless the man who taught Latin at my grade school because we learned it like a baseball game. Knowing all four parts of the verb was a home run. It was exciting to help your team win. Games should not be used as primary sources of motivation but within the context of the proper motivation and presentation, I think they are useful complements. "

So I am an advocate of competition, contests, and prizes in school.

"
  loc: 832

- quote: "In general, integration is the process of connecting or relating data. It means presenting information to the child, not as discrete separate items, but as parts of a whole. The technical definition of “integration” is making a single whole out of a number of parts. Integration is the central process of human cognition. "
  loc: 855

- quote: "The Greeks’ phrase for integration was “the one in the many.” Thales said, “All things are water.” He was applying to metaphysics (matter) which should be applied to epistemology. He was not right that everything in the universe is made of one substance, but his was the correct approach and why he is called the Father of Science and Philosophy. "
  loc: 873

- quote: "That is why you must try to find the common denominators in everything with your students on whatever level. I stress whatever level; it does not have to be a profound philosophic principle which they are unlikely even to understand. For instance, if you are teaching reading and you come across the words “comb” and “tomb,” I would consider it poor teaching if you did not point out the common denominator—a silent b. That of course doesn’t seem like a very big thing to you, but it is a major connection in the child’s mind. Then, when you get to the word “knowledge,” and point out the silent k which is just like the silent b, only a different letter, he is one level of abstraction up. "
  loc: 900

For instance, suppose you were teaching a teenager Othello and he had also read The Fountainhead. One is a Renaissance work and one is modern. One is a play and one is a novel. There are tremendous differences in philosophy and in style. But I would never point out all the differences without saying, “Do you see any two characters, one in each, that have the same basic psychology?” If you wasted that opportunity, it would be a pedagogical crime because juicy issues of integration should never be passed up. Iago and Toohey would be perfect examples to connect. "

Why think at all, if the more you learn, the less you know? You may as well quit while you are ahead, with blissful ignorance. There is no motivation to think, if you can’t acquire knowledge by it. How can you think, if there is no method of thought? The educational establishment has turned skepticism—the view that you can’t have knowledge—into a religion. "

Children were sent to school almost straight from their mother’s knee, and from school they went on to college four or five years earlier than we do. . . . They did learn more, earlier, and more concentratedly than we do. When the child went to school it was not given colored blocks to play with, and supervised in bodily co-ordination (Subsection 4—Skipping the Rope). It was given a copy of the alphabet and taught how to read and write. It began to learn foreign languages and to study the Bible soon after it could read. Shakespeare, who got an average small-town middle-class education, began Latin about the age of seven. Milton . . . was put into Latin by his father at seven and into Greek at nine. . . . The subjects were more limited in number, so that the energies of the pupils were not dissipated. "

As a moral philosopher, her concern was with what men should do with right and wrong. She said, “How am I supposed to know what men should do, apart from the facts of human nature? For that I have to study actual men, what they did and what the results were.” I rejoined, “Why not just study the men around you today? Who cares what happened centuries ago?” She finally made this point clear to me. She said, “How will I know what facts represent man by his nature, and which are mere historical moods or fashions? If I look around today there is tremendous evidence for the desire for conformity. I know it is not true because I know there were the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. I know what man was like in a different era, and therefore I am able to abstract what is the essential that runs through all eras and conditions, and what is just a local variation. I can see what endures. I can discover which causes lead to which effects regardless of current fashions. I know what represents a principle, and what is just a chance variation.” "

Copernicus is a wonderful thing to teach because of the way it simplifies a whole range of observations around one heliocentric theory.

Philosophy is the theory, the abstractions; art is the model builder, the engineer. "

When I said that I represented only myself, he said that he was not interested in individual views, and that he would hear me out only if I represented a group. I protested that my views were as important as those of any group and he countered that I could starve to death if I didn’t like the food and told me to leave. The message was a clear preview of my entire education at Berkeley. The individual never counted there, only the group, which seemed to have an identity and life of its own. "

When I would tell Miss Rand that I did not understand a point while she was answering my questions, she would often reply, “Well, of course you don’t understand; you didn’t let me finish.” I was baffled by that until I finally grasped that integration as a total can occur which makes any given unit within it clear. If you ask certain questions at the wrong time, you make learning impossible. If you keep quiet and even learn to endure momentarily the fact that you do not get something, often a few minutes later you retroactively get it. "

By “discussion,” I do not mean you sit back and say, “OK, your turn now.” I mean a very controlled, delimited discussion for four purposes only: 1. To assess motivation 2. To evaluate understanding 3. To allow exploration 4. To provide a respite        •   Motivation: You have to gauge the students’ motivation and supplement it if necessary. If you see they are not too interested, you have to find out why right away. Let them tell you why they are not interested and have them make the best case they can, as to why this material is not worth knowing. Count on the fact that you can refute their argument.        •   Cognition: You must check whether or not the students are grasping the material. Is there a need for clarification? Are there any errors you can see running through their comments? Are there any points that need review? Now is the time for it.        •   Exploration: I do allow a bit of freewheeling. Let students jump all over the map because, within limits, it has the value of giving them a glimmer of the connections between this unit and the rest of what they are doing. What further questions are there? What further applications? Where else does this subject go? It gives them a chance to grope for their own conclusions.        •   R&R: I do not believe that people (and certainly not children) can focus optimally hour after hour after hour. After ten minutes of pressure buildup where you are exhorting their faculty of focus, a little while to let off steam is appropriate. Let’s face it; it does not really make much difference if they pay attention to what the other students are saying. In fact, it may be preferable that they don`t. "

Teaching obviously requires many things that cannot be taught in an educational institution. For instance, it requires motivation. You must have the desire to teach. But a school of education does not give you motivation; it presupposes it. Teaching requires common sense, it requires experience, and it requires knowledge of the subject matter. None of these comes from a professional school of education. "

If the player is too sick physically, such as with a broken leg, you send him to a hospital or to a specialist to get him to the condition where he can benefit from your football instruction. The same applies here. In teaching, you must assume a mind that is capable of functioning. If not, get the child out of the class and into a hospital or therapy or a home that will be of benefit to him.
