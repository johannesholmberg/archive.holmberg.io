- quote: "Most of the time, if you’re judicious about merging, this kind of thing will never come up. Still, despite your best efforts, merge conflicts sometimes happen anyway.

So it can be comforting to know that Git has a solution—and, as always, Git’s solution is a commit."

- quote: "There’s an old saying (which, like the word “bug,” is popularly attributed to Grace Hopper): A ship in port is safe, but that’s not what ships were built for. Right now, all these commits you’ve been making are safe in the proverbial harbor that is your computer. Let’s send them on a voyage."
