- quote: "There was a serious overpopulation problem, too. All serious diseases had been conquered. So death was voluntary, and the government, to encourage volunteers for death, set up a purple-roofed Ethical Suicide Parlor at every major intersection, right next door to an orange-roofed Howard Johnson’s."

- quote: "The suicide parlors were busy places, because so many people felt silly and pointless, and because it was supposed to be an unselfish, patriotic thing to do, to die. The suicides also got free last meals next door."

- quote: "I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: This is basically a booze problem. If Eliot’s booze were shut off, his compassion for the maggots in the slime on the bottom of the human garbage pail would vanish.”"

- quote: "“It was a perfectly good word—until Eliot got hold of it. It’s spoiled for me now. Eliot did to the word love what the Russians did to the word democracy. If Eliot is going to love everybody, no matter what they are, no matter what they do, then those of us who love particular people for particular reasons had better find ourselves a new word.”"

- quote: "He looked up at an oil painting of his deceased wife. “For instance—I loved her more than I loved our garbage collector, which makes me guilty of the most unspeakable of modern crimes: Dis-crim-i-nay-tion.”"

- quote: "“Like that, Harry?” he asked. “Like what?” “The girl there.” “That’s not a girl. That’s a piece of paper.” “Looks like a girl to me.” Fred Rosewater leered. “Then you’re easily fooled,” said Harry. “It’s done with ink on a piece of paper. That girl isn’t lying there on the counter. She’s thousands of miles away, doesn’t even know we’re alive. If this was a real girl, all I’d have to do for a living would be to stay home and cut out pictures of big fish.”"

- quote: "Giving away a fortune is a futile and destructive thing. It makes whiners of the poor, without making them rich or even comfortable. And the donor and his descendents become undistinguished members of the whining poor.”"

- quote: "“God damn you for calling this number! You should go to jail and rot! Stupid sons of bitches who make personal calls on a fire department line should go to hell and fry forever!” He slammed the receiver down. A few seconds later, the black telephone rang. “This is the Rosewater Foundation,” said Eliot sweetly. “How can we help you?” “Mr. Rosewater—this is Mary Moody again.” She was sobbing. “What on earth is the trouble, dear?” He honestly didn’t know. He was ready to kill whoever had made her cry."

- quote: "The reason creatures wanted to use language instead of mental telepathy was that they found out they could get so much more done with language. Language made them so much more active. Mental telepathy, with everybody constantly telling everybody everything, produced a sort of generalized indifference to all information. But language, with its slow, narrow meanings, made it possible to think about one thing at a time—to start thinking in terms of projects."
