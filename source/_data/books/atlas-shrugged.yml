I often wonder about the hours when a man sits alone, watching the smoke of a cigarette, thinking. I wonder what great things have come from such hours. When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind—and it is proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression.”"

He looked bewildered. “I came to tell you—” “If you have anything to say to me, start over again.” “What?” “Don’t tell me what you’re going to allow me to do.” “Well, I meant we’re not going to allow our men to run your train.” “That’s different.”"

He shouldn’t be allowed to produce so much that he’ll swamp everybody else off the market. . . .
