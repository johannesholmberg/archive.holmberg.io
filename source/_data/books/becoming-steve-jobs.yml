- quote: "“What’s the point in looking back,” he told me in one email. “I’d rather look forward to all the good things to come.”"
  loc: 258

- quote: "The failures, stinging reversals, miscommunications, bad judgment calls, emphases on wrong values—the whole Pandora’s box of immaturity—were necessary prerequisites to the clarity, moderation, reflection, and steadiness he would display in later years."
  loc: 268

- quote: "He believed deeply in the value of what he chose to do with his life, and he hoped those close to him believed in the value of their work just as deeply."

- quote: "These advances often are foreign concepts, after all, with potential that seems opaque if not daunting, so the job of a great marketer is to wrestle the concept back to earth and make it approachable for mere technophobic mortals."
  loc: 912

- quote: "“Our whole company is founded on the principle that there is something very different that happens with one person, one computer. It’s very different than having ten people to one computer. What we’re trying to do is remove the barrier of having to learn how to use a computer.”"

- quote: "For all its beauty, from the lush landscaping out front to the meticulously crafted wheeled tables on which the computer components rolled through the assembly process, the NeXT factory turned out to be a sinkhole. Forget producing 600 computers a day: the factory never produced more than 600 machines in a single month."

- quote: "Amelio tried to put his company’s problems in perspective for the other guests. “Apple is a boat,” he said. “There’s a hole in the boat, and it’s taking on water. But there’s also a treasure on board. And the problem is, everyone on board is rowing in different directions, so the boat is just standing still. My job is to get everyone rowing in the same direction.” After Amelio walked away, Ellison turned to the person standing next to him and asked, “But what about the hole?” That was one story Steve never got tired of telling."

- quote: "One of the themes Steve came back to at several points in the program was how important it can be to try to look at things from another perspective, just to test your assumptions."

- quote: "He also felt certain that within a year or two, recordable CD-ROM drives would render floppy disk drives redundant.

  loc: 4624

- quote: "“You know,” Steve told him, “you reminded me of something I learned at Pixar. On almost every film they make, something turns out to be not quite right. And they have an amazing willingness to turn around and do it again, till they do get it right. They have always had a willingness to not be governed by the release date. It’s not about how fast you do something, it’s about doing your level best.”"

- quote: "He was always big on going for walks with people. So he would take the director out on a walk, where you talked more slowly, you think through things … just talking, just a friendly back-and-forth talking. His goal was just to help them make a better movie."
  loc: 5478

- quote: "He learned; he had taken the mistakes that he made, internalized and processed them, and made some changes.”"
  loc: 5485

- quote: "“There’s the object, the actual product itself, and then there’s all that you learned. What you learned is as tangible as the product itself, but much more valuable because that’s your future. You can see where that goes and demand more of yourself, being so unreasonable in what you expect of yourself and what we expect of each other, that it yields these even more amazing results, not just in the product but in what you’ve learned.”"
  loc: 5838

- quote: "It is hard enough to see what is already there, to remove the many impediments to a clear view of reality, but Steve’s gift was even greater: he saw clearly what was not there, what could be there, what had to be there."
