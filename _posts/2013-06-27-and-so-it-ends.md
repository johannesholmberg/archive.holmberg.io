Since I wrote last, I’ve been traversing this vast country up north. After spending some time in a desolate Goa I finally hit Bombay. 

Bombay is one of those places that you can’t really believe exists until you’re in the middle of it. It’s the first time I experience that kind of compactness from a city.

From Bombay I flew up to the desert capital of Jaipur and via Agra to see the Taj Mahal, I came to New Delhi and that’s where I’m currently at. 

It’s been nearly 6 months since I first set out on this undefined trip and I can’t believe now that it’s soon about to end.

When I started, I had no idea where it would take me, where I would end up or what I would be doing. That was all part of the charm I was looking for. There is freedom in improvised traveling and I am very happy with all the opportunities I got to take part of since I was running an open schedule.

It’s been a time full of reflection, full of trying new ideas, full of meeting interesting people.

If I got to do it again, would there be something that I would do differently? I honestly don’t think so. I’m very happy with how the minimalist light-weight traveling worked out. Having all my packing to fit in just a [16 liter backpack](http://www.goruck.com/en/gr-echo#.U4N7f5SSwZc) made things so much easier and it was never a problem to catch a bus when I was running late. I could easily just carry it with me when I had to check out from my accommodation and wait for a late ride to the next destination. There was no need to leave it anywhere. I never felt that I was missing something.

What was the best with the trip? The freedom and responsibility that comes with the everyday decision of either staying or leaving. And if leaving, where to? I could have made all those choices while I was still safe at home, before I left. I could have planned everyday beforehand. I didn’t do that because, as a friend neatly put it; it would be like passively viewing exhibitions at a museum.

I do know it’s tricky to get the time required but if you should have the opportunity, I definitely recommend improvised traveling and discover as you go. Then you will not evade choices with the excuse that it’s already been made for you, by a yesterday version of yourself. You will have to face responsibility of taking decisions every day. For me, that is freedom.

Tonight I am flying to Dubai where I will meet up with an old friend. Together we’re gonna see some places in Europe before finally hitting Swedish ground again at the end of summer.

This publication has been an experiment for me to develop my language, my thoughts and to test my ideas. I want to thank all of you very much for having been part of it during this time and it’s been a pleasure to read all your feedback and responses.
