intro: 'If you have a product that fills a need or creates a desire, and you take care to design it well, you’ll do better than someone who has a similar product that isn’t designed well. If you disagree, feel free to toss your brown Zune across the room in anger.'

>Take a baseball mitt. Study it for a bit, and it becomes obvious that your hand goes inside. That’s form. The minute you have the mitt on, you understand it makes it easier to catch a baseball. That’s function.

>Yet when we build websites or apps, we often wait until the last minute to bring in designers to “apply” design, or look and feel. This is akin to baking a cake and then hiring a baker to make it taste good.

>Would you let your cousin’s best friend do your accounting because they had a calculator? Or let your neighbor reprogram your fuel injection system because they have three cars on blocks on their lawn? Probably not.

>Research isn’t an optional phase of design; it’s the keystone under which everything else rests. Unless we take time to properly survey the landscape and approach our work with a solid understanding of the problem, everything we do is costly guesswork.

>Some of the things you see will be right, some will be wrong. It’s important you tell me which is which. You can’t hurt my feelings—it’s part of the job. Your negative feedback is more valuable than your positive feedback. If you don’t speak up when something isn’t working, I won’t have a chance to fix it, which will cost us time and money we don’t have. Let’s promise to be totally, brutally honest with one another. Ready?
