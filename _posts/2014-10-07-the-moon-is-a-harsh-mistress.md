>That we were slaves I had known all my life – and nothing could be done about it. True we weren’t bought and sold – but as long as Authority held monopoly over what we had to have and what we could sell to buy it, we were slaves.

>I started electronics under him, soon was teaching him. So he stopped charging and we went along together until he dug up an engineer willing to daylight for extra money – whereupon we both paid new teacher and Prof tried to stick with me, thumb-fingered and slow, but happy to be stretching his mind.

>That’s when I started living, Mannie; I studied politics and economics and history and learned to speak in public and turned out to have a flair for organization. It’s satisfying work because I believe in it – I know that Luna will be free.

>‘What do you mean by “correct organization”?’ ‘Functional organization. How does one design an electric motor? Would you attach a bathtub to it, simply because one was available? Would a bouquet of flowers help? A heap of rocks? No, you would use just those elements necessary to its purpose and make it no longer than needed – and you would incorporate safety factors. Function controls design.

>Organization must be no larger than necessary – never recruit anyone merely because he wants to join. Nor seek to persuade for the pleasure of having another share your views.

>‘Much theorizing has gone into optimum cell size. I think that history shows that a cell of three is best – more than three can’t agree on when to have dinner, much less when to strike. Manuel, you belong to a large family; do you vote on when to have dinner?’

>A rational anarchist believes that concepts such as “state” and “society” and “government” have no existence save as physically exemplified in the acts of self-responsible individuals. He believes that it is impossible to shift blame, share blame, distribute blame … as blame, guilt, responsibility are matters taking place inside human beings singly and nowhere else.

>But being rational, he knows that not all individuals hold his evaluations, so he tries to live perfectly in an imperfect world … aware that his effort will be less than perfect yet undismayed by self-knowledge of self-failure.

>‘Too much power in the hands of individuals – surely you would not want … well, H-missiles for example – to be controlled by one irresponsible person?’ ‘My point is that one person is responsible. Always. If H-bombs exist – and they do – some man controls them. In terms of morals there is no such thing as a “state.” Just men. Individuals. Each responsible for his own acts.’

>‘Dear lady, I’ll happily accept your rules.’ ‘But you don’t seem to want any rules!’ ‘True. But I will accept any rules that you feel necessary to your freedom. I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.’

>“There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” And isn’t,’ I added, pointing to a Free Lunch sign across room, ‘or these drinks would cost half as much. Was reminding her that anything free costs twice as much in long run or turns out worthless.’

>An earthworm expects to find a law, a printed law, for every circumstance. Even have laws for private matters such as contracts. Really. If a man’s word isn’t any good, who would contract with him? Doesn’t he have reputation?

>Sir, there was a time when it was not simply expensive to ship goods across oceans but impossible. Then it was expensive, difficult, dangerous. Today you sell goods half around your planet almost as cheaply as next door; long-distance shipping is the least important factor in cost.

>‘Let’s take that one at a time,’ I said. ‘First, what is it you want us to pay taxes for? Tell me what I get and perhaps I’ll buy it. No, put it this way. Do you pay taxes?’ ‘Certainly I do! And so should you.’ ‘And what do you get for your taxes?’

>‘But in writing your constitution let me invite attention to the wonderful virtues of the negative! Accentuate the negative! Let your document be studded with things the government is forever forbidden to do. No conscript armies … no interference however slight with freedom of press, or speech, or travel, or assembly, or of religion, or of instruction, or communication, or occupation … no involuntary taxation. Comrades, if you were to spend five years in a study of history while thinking of more and more things that your government should promise never to do and then let your constitution be nothing but those negatives, I would not fear the outcome.

>But if you really believe that your neighbors must have laws for their own good, why shouldn’t you pay for it? Comrades, I beg you – do not resort to compulsory taxation. There is no worse tyranny than to force a man to pay for what he does not want merely because you think it would be good for him.’

>Never will understand people! We spent three days warning them – and you couldn’t say they hadn’t heard warnings; that was why they were there. To see show. To laugh at our nonsense. To get ‘souvenirs.’ Whole families went to targets, some with picnic baskets. Picnic baskets! Bojemoi!
