    <p>When not sitting in front of the screen trying to make these puzzle pieces fit, I am usually out hiking somewhere in the forest. It gives some peace. And inspiration. You find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannesholmberg">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/hlmberg">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jholmberg">GitHub</a>.

    <h2 class="icon icon-magnifier">About this website</h2>
    <p>This website was made for the purpose of creating a digital home to collect the writing and the work I do. The last couple of years I have downsized on my social media appearance and wanted to have a simple home where I can experiment at my own pace.</p>

    <p>It’s built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and hosted at <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">MediaTemple</a>. All CSS is written using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. The task manager I use is <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> helps me keep track of packages. The typeface I am using is Source Sans Pro from Adobe. Icons come from the <a href="http://www.streamlineicons.com/">Streamline icon library</a>. Photos are taken by <a href="http://erikcarlsson.se/">Erik Carlsson</a>.
