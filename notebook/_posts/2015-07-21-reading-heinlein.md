What is it that makes me so fascinated every time I pick up one of Robert Heinlein's books?

I think they have exactly the right mix of ingredients which resonates with my own interests. Technology, politics, philosophyâ€”all packed in an intriguing story with interesting characters. The books format is mainly driven by dialogue, helping to better understand the characters and what drives them. That kind of recipe makes it for me.

Science Fiction is amazing in that regard, it's an art form with science as the foundation. The opportunities are endless and it's thrilling to look forward to the kind of future and the characters with that future which is represented in Mr. Heinlein's books.
