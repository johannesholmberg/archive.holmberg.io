Last day of the German project. The other day I started the course in town that I had signed up for. Originally it was planned to start at the beginning of the month, but since it was too few attendants back then, it got postponed.
{: .intro}

It’s been very rewarding to only focus on one big thing this month and I can feel the result. The last few days I have started speaking with much bigger confidence than ever. I’ve stopped being shy and just let go with it. I think it has to do with that I have a much better grasp of the grammatical structure of the language now than before. Even if I make mistakes, I have the tools to correct them.

Throughout this month I have been [reading][r] [books][b], newspapers, watched TV and had conversations—all in German. Additionally I’ve listened to podcasts helping me with the grammatical part and made my own practice on [german.net][g].

What was unfortunate was that I went for vacation in the middle of it which threw me off course a bit, but I managed to get back on track in the end. A big plus with this focus is that I’ve published more on my website in one month than I’ve had ever before. It was a neccessary practice to try and document the progress.

So, what would be the focus for November? I haven’t really decided yet. German will still be a big part since I will continue my course but I would like to focus on some creative part of my life. Maybe drawing. Maybe doing some 3D work. I will take the weekend to think it over.
