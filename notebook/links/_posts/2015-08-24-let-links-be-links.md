This means that if developers use a single ES6 syntax feature, or even make a single standard library function call without checking that the function has been defined first, their JavaScript could either stop running midway through execution or not run at all. When JavaScript is used to enhance websites, this doesn’t matter so much—visitors can still follow links and submit forms and generally use the web as intended. But when JavaScript is a requirement, anyone using even a slightly older browser is likely to get a blank page—and no explanation of what to do about it.
