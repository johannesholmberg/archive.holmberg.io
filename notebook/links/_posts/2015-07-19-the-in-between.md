> “Break. Points. Points at which things break in your design. But, at what point did they start becoming ‘the point at which I will create a new layout entirely’, or ‘the point at which I introduce a new canvas’. What started out as a method to optimise your designs for various screen widths has turned, ever so slowly, into multiple canvas design. We’re creating pages again, and we probably need to stop it.”
