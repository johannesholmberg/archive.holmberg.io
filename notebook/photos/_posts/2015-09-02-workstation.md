The place I call home. This is my home office where Iâ€™ve spent the better part of 2015. I like how the office has come together over the year. I especially like how the sloping part of the roof creates a form of shelter over the desk, feels like a little cave I can creep into and get some focused work done. Will probably post some more photos of the other parts of the room later.
