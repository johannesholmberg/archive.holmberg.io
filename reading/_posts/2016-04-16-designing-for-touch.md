It's been time to catch up on some web related reading (this industry is evolving at such an incredulous speed...) and I turned my focus to *Designing for Touch*. This book highlighted a lot of challenges we face today when more and more of the devices we use to access the web are touch driven.

There are a lot of good rules I took away from this book and also some great research on the subject, for instance that 75% on the interaction on a phone is being made by thumbs. And that the edges on a tablet is where you should put important actions, since it's easy to reach and require less effort of the user. Everything that Clark is mentioning makes sense but it was still an eye-opener for me and I got a lot of good material for future design reviews. The rest of my highlights are below.
