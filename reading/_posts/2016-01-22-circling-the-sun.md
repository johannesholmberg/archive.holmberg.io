The first book I ever picked solely based on its cover. A woman dressed in slacks and  rolled up sleeves, sitting by a table with a glass of scotch, looking out over the golden African landscape. This image has so much inspiration and power in it that I just had to start reading and find out more about who this person is.

This is a fictional biography based on the life of Beryl Markham. Early in her life, Beryl's family upped and moved from England to Kenya. This was just in the infancy of the 20th century. There she get a strong connection to the country and the animals. She especially likes horses and to be out hunting in the wild. Later Beryl came to be one of the most renowned trainers in whole Africa. She was also one of the early pioneers in aviation and in 1936 she became the first woman to ever cross the Atlantic, east to west.

I fell in love with the book and its romantic image of Africa. I enjoyed reading about how Beryl's experiences and choices led her to the strong, independent woman she came to be. Her views and goals in life is something completely remarkable for being at the beginning of the last century. Big recommendation.
