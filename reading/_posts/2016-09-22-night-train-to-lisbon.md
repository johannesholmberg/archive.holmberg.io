After finishing the beautiful *About Grace* I had no idea what to read next. I had a discussion with a friend and she mentioned *Night Train to Lisbon*. That title would usually be enough for me to never ever pick it up. It sounds like a cheesy romantic story from the 80's. But I started a sample anyway and the story blew me away.

Raimund Gregorious is a historic language teacher at the University of Bern. He's been with the school for the last 40 years but one day he starts exploring the life of Amadeu Prado, a Portuguese doctor living under a dictatorship, and before the day is over he's on his way to Lisbon.

He's ecstatic about the life of this philosophical doctor and decides to travel to Lisbon and see if he can find out more.

There are just so many beautiful sentences in this book. It's written almost as a salution to the awareness of life itself. I enjoyed the writing through till the end.
