Just after finishing [*Rocket Ship Galileo*](/reading/rocket-ship-galileo), I moved on to the next in line of Heinlein novels. *Space Cadet* is mainly the story of the Space Patrol, or rather touching on the process of becoming one. We follow Matt Dodson through the Space Academy in his quest of joining the prestigious Patrol.
{: .intro }

Space has been a fascinating subject to me as of late. I think that man has every possibility to become spacefaring, and it's especially interesting at the moment because of everything that happens around SpaceX. Reading Heinleinâ€™s novels is both a thrilling experience because of the story itself and also from a philosophical standpoint in how humans would evolve if we would start to colonize the rest of the universe.
