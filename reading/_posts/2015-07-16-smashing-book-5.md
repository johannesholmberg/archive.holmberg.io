**Smashing Magazine** is one of the top distributors of knowledge in my field so when they release a new book with curated top content—of course I pick it up.

The book, as usual, contains several articles covering the latest methods and techniques available. I didn’t finish all articles but jumped between the ones that will help me in my daily work.

My favorite article in this book is the one covering flexbox by [Zoe M. Gillenwater](http://zomigi.com/). I learned this new technique on a deeper lever from how I understood it before and that's what made me redo the header navigation of this site using flexbox.

My highlights are below.
