**When I read** [Steve Jobs](/reading/steve-jobs), I found out there were two books that Steve especially liked and had come back to several times over the course of his life. One was [Autobiography of a Yogi](/reading/autobiography-of-a-yogi). The other one was Be Here Now. That tickled my interest since I hadn't had much experience of this type of writing previously.

There are a lot of insightful proverbs in this book.
