A book I've been struggling with for a long time. It feels like a great achievement to finally have finished this. The language is pretty hard at times and the book is longer than anything I've previously read in German, around 350 physical pages.
{: .intro}

The story is structured in this fictional biographical style that appeals to me so much. You follow the ship captain and explorer, John Franklin, as he figures out his own system for how to act in the world. John finds out for himself already when he's a boy that he needs time and preparation to do just about anything. Then you follow along as he expands this systematic way of thinking all through his life.
