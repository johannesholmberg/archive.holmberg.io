<p class="intro" markdown="1">**Just recently finished** reading The Martian. I’d seen the trailer for the upcoming movie and I was excited by it. Pondered for some time if I should read the book or just wait for the movie to come out. I chose the book and boy was I happy with that. It’s a crazy ride.</p>

It starts out with reading from Mark Watney’s log book: “I’m pretty much fucked. That’s my considered opinion. Fucked.” Watney’s stuck on Mars after an aborted space mission. Everybody thinks he’s dead. Only that he’s not.

The way that Andy Weir is telling this story can by no means be transfered to a movie so I’m thrilled to see how they’re gonna pull it off for that medium. He writes in a parallel way so that the logs from Watney and discussions back on earth is what is driving the story forward. Also, once in a while he tells the story by sharing it from the perspective of an object or from the planet itself. The book would still be exceptional if it only had Watney’s logs but this alternation brings it up another level.

I read the kindle version and my highlights are below.
