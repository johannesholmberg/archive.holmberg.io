<p class="intro" markdown="1">**Here I go again**, reading another Heinlein. Well, it's been like [4 months](/reading/methuselahs-children/) so I don't think anyone can blame me. Farmer in the Sky encapsulates the spirit of man always being on the verge. That essence in humans, driving us to go further and further.</p>
