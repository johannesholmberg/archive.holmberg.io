<p class="intro" markdown="1">**I had no idea** what to read after I finished [Steve Jobs](/reading/steve-jobs). But I liked the experience of reading on the iPad and wanted to continue my new habit. When I was browsing the book store in iTunes I came upon this book which sounded interesting from its description.</p>

I was completely blown away. I had no idea who Murakami was when I started. I do now. He has a very personal tone and he mixes fantasy with the real world in a very natural way. It’s hard to explain it for people who hasn’t read him.

I got a couple of great highlights that I take away from this book.
