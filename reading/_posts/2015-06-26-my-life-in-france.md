**Julia Child** came to France in the late 40’s and was mesmerized by the food of the country. After taking cooking lessons, she soon started working on publishing her own cookbook together with some new friends. This is an inspiring memoire how Julia and her husband Paul managed to make a living in France through the 50’s, 60’s and the 70’s. Thanks to [Susan Robertsson](https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/) and her recommendation which made me pick this book up.
