I finally got around to read *1984*. I am mostly fascinated about how utterly different the parts in the book are. There are 3 parts and each is a bit like a self-contained book in itself, and differ very much in style.

 I had so many preconceptions about how bleak and gray this story would be, that it would be hard and complicated to read it. That was not the case at all.

It was actually a great and appealing story to me, set in this dystopian world. At the middle of the book, when Winston Smith is unfolding his path of becoming more and more self aware, I thought I couldn't wait to start the book all over again. That's how well written and inspiring it was. But it turned for the bad and the last part is very dark and horrendous.

The worst concept presented in the book is a ministry concerned with developing the new language *Newspeak*. Their task is to diminish language to its bare essentials, to limit the range of consciousness, so that people wonâ€™t ever have the means to rebel against the tyranny state.

My highlights below.
