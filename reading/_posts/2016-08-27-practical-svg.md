Time to read another technical book. When I saw this book coming out I thought it was a perfect fit for me. I work with SVG on almost a daily basis but there are many things I'm still wrestling with.

As with all other A Book Apart creations, *Practical SVG* helped me to a better understanding of the work I do. Everything from setting up an automated workflow to some neat CSS tricks for handling SVG was covered in this book.

I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to set up a robust icon system.
