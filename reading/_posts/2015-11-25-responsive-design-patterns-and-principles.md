The books from A Book Apart are immensely helpful. They’re covering a single subject, are brief and to the point. I’ve delightfully picked each and every one up over the years and they have taught me so much. I see them as the de facto standard for where our industry is heading.

In this book about patterns and principles for responsive design, Ethan sheds some light on problems we have at the moment with frameworks and a lack of design language for this relatively young medium.

Instead of labeling a screen as “mobile”, “tablet” or “desktop” it would be far more helpful to classify _features_ instead. If we start discussing around input methods, screen sizes and network speeds we may be much more effective in tailoring our components and layouts.

There were many helpful topics in this book and I recommend it to anyone who is working on the web.
