intro: 'The danger is that after testing in a downloaded Google Chrome, web developers may think they’ve covered all modern Android devices. That’s not true. Your downloaded Google Chrome only tells you something about Google devices and other downloaded Google Chromes, and not about Samsung Chrome or Amazon Silk or possible future Chromium-based browsers.'
