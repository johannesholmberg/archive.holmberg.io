<p class="intro" markdown="1">**Island was another book** I picked out from a [Lost reference](http://coyotemercury.com/2007/03/21/the-lost-book-club-stranger-in-a-strange-land/). I see this book as one of the starting points that got me interested in minimalism. [Aldous Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley) brings up many topics in this book about a regular westerner exploring the distant and unknown island Pala. With the book he is questioning human society and how it functions today by showing how different it actually could be.</p>

It started me questioning my own behavior and I took away a lot of great highlights from this book.
