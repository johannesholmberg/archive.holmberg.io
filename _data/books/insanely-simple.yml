- quote: "Common Sense would suggest that when Microsoft created the Zune store to compete with the iTunes store, it would have charged a fixed price per song, much as Apple did. Instead, it offered “Microsoft Points”, which required customers to purchase points by the hundred, then use a conversion rate of eighty points to the dollar to buy a ninety-nine-cent song. The architect of that scheme seems to be missing the Common Sense gene-and those who approved it were a bit light in the Brains department."

- quote: "Steve had a rule that there could never be more than one hundred people on the Mac team. So if you wanted to add someone, you had to take someone out. And the thinking was a typical Steve Jobs observation: “I can’t remember more than a hundred first names, so I only want to be around people that I know personally. So if it gets bigger than a hundred people, it will force us to go to a different organization structure where I can’t work that way. The way I like to work is where I touch everything. Through the whole time I knew him at Apple that’s exactly how he ran his division."

- quote: "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things we have done. Innovation is saying no to a thousand things."

Steve caught it, no problem, and tossed it back. “That’s a good ad,” said Lee. “Now catch this,” he said, as he threw all five paper balls in Steve’s direction. Steve didn’t catch a single one, and they bounced onto the table and floor. “That’s a bad ad,” said Lee."

- quote: "It drove Steve batty to see in twenty slides what could be spoken in three sentences. He valued time way too much for that. He preferred straight talk and raw content to a slick presentation. In fact, a slick presentation would only make him suspect that you were fluffing up the few facts you really had. It meant that you’d devoted valuable time to the wrapping of your idea rather than thinking through the idea itself."

  loc:

- quote: "A true friend of Simplicity will at least remain open to the possibility of rejecting an expert’s advice after considering other factors, as opposed to reflexively implementing it."

- quote: "When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there.
