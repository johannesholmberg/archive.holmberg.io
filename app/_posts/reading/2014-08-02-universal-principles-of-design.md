intro: 'Consider priming in all aspects of design. First impressions, contexts, and antecedent events are all opportunities to influence subsequent reactions and behaviors — this includes the way products are presented in packaging, the articles adjacent to advertisements in newspapers, and the experiences leading from the parking lot to the entryway of a retail store.'

> People prefer the path of least resistance when making decisions. When the path of least resistance happens to lead to a generally favorable outcome everyone is happy. When the path of least resistance leads to a generally unfavorable outcome, however, the results are problematic. For example, when the default option for new employees is to not be registered for a basic pension program savings rates are very low. However, when the default option is to enroll employees automatically into a basic pension plan savings rates increase dramatically.

> Provide visible and immediate feedback for actions and inactions (e.g., many modern automobiles have alert lights on the dashboard that stay on until the seatbelt is fastened, increasing seatbelt usage).

> Consider nudges in the design of objects and environments where behavior modification is key. Set default states that correspond to the most generally desired option, not the most conservative option. Provide clear, visible, and immediate feedback to reinforce desired actions and mildly punish undesired behaviors. Align incentives with desired behaviors, being careful to avoid incentive conflict. Simplify and structure choices when decision-making parameters are complex. Make goals and performance status clearly visible.

> To reduce the cleaning burden of the men’s restrooms in the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, the image of a fly was etched into each of the bowls just above the drains. The result was an 80 percent reduction in “spillage.” Why? When people see a target, they try to hit it.

>Operant conditioning is commonly applied to animal training, instructional design, video game design, incentive programs, gambling devices, counseling, and behavioral therapy. It is also finding increased application in artificial intelligence. There are three basic operant conditioning techniques: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and punishment.

>Positive reinforcement increases the probability of a behavior by associating the behavior with a positive condition; pulling the lever on a slot machine results in positive visual and auditory feedback, and a possible monetary reward.

>Negative reinforcement increases the probability of a behavior by associating the behavior with the removal of a negative condition; fastening a seat belt in a car silences an annoying buzzer.

>Performance load is the degree of mental and physical activity required to achieve a goal. If the performance load is high, performance time and errors increase, and the probability of successfully accomplishing the goal decreases.

>Modern slot machines no longer require the pulling of a lever or the insertion of coins to play. Inserting a charge card and pressing a button is all that is required, though the lever continues to be retained as a usable ornament. This reduction in kinematic load not only makes it easier to play the slots, it makes it easier for casinos to make money.

>The reasons people prefer one design to another is a combination of many factors, and may have nothing to do with performance. Is the design pleasing to look at? Does it compete with long-standing designs or standards of use? Does it contribute to the well-being or self-esteem of the user? These are all factors that must be carefully balanced in the development of the design requirements.

>Progressive disclosure is also used in the physical world to manage the perception of complexity and activity. For example, progressive disclosure is found in the design of entry points for modern theme park rides. Exceedingly long lines not only frustrate people in line, but also discourage new people from the ride. Theme park designers progressively disclose discrete segments of the line (sometimes supplemented with entertainment), so that no one, in or out of the line, ever sees the line in its entirety.

>Use progressive disclosure to reduce information complexity, especially when people interacting with the design are novices or infrequent users. Hide infrequently used controls or information, but make them readily available through some simple operation, such as pressing a More button. Progressive disclosure is also an effective method for leading people through complex procedures, and should be considered when such procedures are a part of a design.

>The design goal of prospect-refuge can be summarized as the development of spaces where people can see without being seen. Consider prospect-refuge in the creation of landscapes, residences, offices, and communities. Create multiple vantage points within a space, so that the internal and external areas can be easily surveyed. Make large, open areas more appealing by using screening elements to create partial refuges with side- and back-barriers while maintaining clear lines of sight (e.g., shrubbery, partitions). Balance the use of prospect and refuge elements for optimal effect—e.g., sunken floors and ceilings that open to larger spaces enclosed by windows and glass doors.

>People tend to prefer savanna-like environments—open areas, scattered trees, water, and uniform grassiness—to other natural environments that are simple, such as desert; dense, such as jungle; or complex, such as mountains.

>Interaction assumptions occur when designers scale a design, and assume that the way people and other systems interact with the design will be the same at other levels of scale. For example, the design of very tall buildings involves many possible interactions that do not exist for buildings of lesser size—problems of evacuation in the case of fire, people seeking to commit suicide or base-jump off of the roof, symbolic target for terrorist attacks, to name a few. These kinds of interaction effects are usually an indirect consequence of the design, and therefore can be difficult to anticipate and manage.

>The scaling fallacy is nowhere more apparent than with flight. For example, at very small and very large scales, flapping to fly is not a viable strategy. At very small scales, wings are too small to effectively displace air molecules. At very large scales, the effects of gravity are too great for flapping to work—a painful lesson learned by many early pioneers of human flight. The lesson is that designs can be effective at one scale, and completely ineffective at another.

>Few principles move humans to action more effectively than scarcity. When items and opportunities become scarce, so too does their general desirability, and even people who are otherwise disinterested often find themselves motivated to act.

>Serial position effects occur when people try to recall items from a list; items at the beginning and end are better recalled than the items in the middle. The improved recall for items at the beginning of a list is called a primacy effect. The improved recall for items at the end of a list is called a recency effect.
