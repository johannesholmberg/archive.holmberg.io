intro: '“You won’t find me coming home with five cheap suits, one for each day of the week. I’d rather have one perfect suit or none.”'

>“Don’t be sorry. But I want you to understand. Nobody’s influenced me. Why should I copy the Japanese or the Aztecs or anybody else when I can make something beautiful of my own? It all comes from here.” He tapped a finger on one temple. “And from nature.”

>She looked at him skeptically. “So I shouldn’t worry about money.” Frank sighed. “No, it always comes. It’s never been the reason I practice architecture. But money can buy beautiful things, and I need beautiful things around me. I’m an artist, Mame. You more than anyone should comprehend that. Beautiful objects stimulate me, they inspire me. Look at this.”

>“I don’t buy junk. When I buy something, it’s got to be perfection or I don’t want it.”

>“Simple food,” he said, tearing apart a piece of crusty bread, “is the only good food. My mother knew this, and the Italian peasant knows this.

>“You found houses made out of the same mud the Etruscans used,” Frank said. “Buildings that spring naturally from the earth where they stand.” He pointed his fork in Taylor’s direction. “Mud huts are the people’s architectural folk tales. Pay attention to the folk tales, Woolley.”

>But if we’re ever going to achieve an architecture of our own in America—a democratic architecture that expresses the spirit of the place—then we have to change the way we teach young minds. Is there a university-trained architect in America today whose head hasn’t been filled with Beaux Arts crap? They’re all decorators, for Christ’s sake!” Frank was pacing now. “We need to show young people there’s more to design than the Greek column. What happened to the spirit of individualism? My God, isn’t that what our democracy is supposed to be about? Yet what are America’s architects doing? They’re mimicking the architectural traditions of monarchies!”

>Most astounding to Mamah was the space within; it was a dimension unto itself. What could be more expressive of the American ideal than a home where a person could feel sheltered and free at the same time? She loved sitting near the fireplace and looking out through the spacious living room to the fields and sky beyond. It was as if there were no walls to limit her view or thoughts or spirit as they expanded out and out. This was the “democratic architecture” Frank had been straining to achieve since she’d known him. Often she had heard him say that the reality of a building is the space within. And what you put into that space will affect how you live in it and what you become. Here at Taliesin he didn’t want to clutter the place with stuff that did not ennoble them. She felt the same.

>He needed to build, he would say, slamming more logs into a pile in the living room. Who was he otherwise? He had to have partners in his work, people who would pay for the materials of his art, who would provide themselves and their dreams as material to inspire him. To lose clients meant so much more than losing income. It meant the loss of an essential dynamic. He would continue to design; he couldn’t really stop himself. But to build, to interact with a place and its materials, to make the decisions along the way that breathed life into a space…

>Sometimes her foot would touch his under the table during dinner, and he would make a great show of moving his foot away, adjusting his position in relation to her, as if to say, Are you quite finished arranging yourself?

>“Why do you do that?” she’d asked him once.  
“Do what?”  
“Push aside your silver that way, as if you’re angry.”  
“I hate clutter.”  
“Silverware is clutter?” she asked.  
“Until I’m ready to use it, yes.”

>“When I find beautiful things, it feels as if they are necessary tools for my life. I can’t bear to have old junk around, disturbing the peace. Better a space be empty. But we have been here two years, and when I saw the chairs and rugs, I had to buy them—for my sanity, Mamah. Can you possibly understand that? It’s part of finishing a piece of art.”
