description: 'There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one’s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions.'

"Why don’t they ask me to ground them?" "Because they’re crazy, that’s why." "Of course they’re crazy," Doc Daneeka replied. "I just told you they’re crazy, didn’t I? And you can’t let crazy people decide whether you’re crazy or not, can you?"

>His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn’t earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce.
