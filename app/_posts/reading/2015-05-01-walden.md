I picked up Walden to remind myself a little bit of the state I was in, [in early 2013](/journal/getting-on-that-plane). During this time I tried [living as simple as possible](/journal/simplify) and had but the most basic possessions available. It was a mental relief and very exciting time of my life. Walden reminds me how simple and beautiful life can be.

Here are my highlights from the book.
