  desc: '“Talking about the creative brief at the start of the meeting has an interesting outcome we should’ve thought of before: It lets us separate our discussions of where we’re going with our design from what we build to get there.”'

  title: 'Give me file hierarchies, or give me chaos.'
  desc: '“To my way of thinking, passive management of file assets is okay for screwing around with iPads, where we’re mainly watching TV on Netflix or obsessive-compulsively checking the popularity of our Instagram uploads. But for real work, and even for passionate hobby work (like managing family photos), give me files and folders any day.”'

  title: 'How Designers Destroyed the World'
  desc: '“Designers have a responsibility, not only to themselves and to their clients, but also to the wider world. We are designers because we love to create, but creation without responsibility breeds destruction. Every day, designers all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them. This needs to change.”'

  desc: '<q>I feel your pain every time I encounter a shop or company that brags about its full-stack expertise but writes markup like it’s 1999. Or, just as bad, like it’s 2003: all meaningless spans and divs, half of them there purely as visual hooks, and the other half there because the developers didn’t know what to cut out of the framework they used (and didn’t consider that a problem, figuring that gzipping everything would take care of the performance aspects).</q>'

  title: 'Resetting Agency Culture'
  desc: '<q>For many agencies, what I’m advocating represents a shift in thinking, a shift in process, a shift in how we track and value employees’ time. But we’ve made similar shifts before—like when we had to begin advocating for the user at the discovery level, bringing UX into the forefront of our approaches. Today, it’s exceedingly evident that time spent on UX is vital for a digital project’s livelihood; we need to apply that same reevaluation to time spent on employee success.</q>'
