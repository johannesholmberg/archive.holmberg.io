<p class="intro" markdown="1">**Hello there**, and thanks for checking by.
I’m a freelance designer/developer living and working in [Basel](https://www.google.ch/search?q=basel&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1805&amp;bih=1229&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI9u35psaSxwIVwbIUCh0pJAaP).
I created my first personal website in 2003 but it wasn't until 2007 that I made the web my main business. Since then I've been creating user interfaces at web agencies, consultancies and as an [“in-houser”](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/in-house.asp).</p>

## Johannes Holmberg
8 years experience of designing and developing usable online solutions. What I do is making design and technology work together on the web. My services include interaction design, information architecture and front-end development. I work together with teams from companies all over the world to provide responsive and optimized user interfaces. I’ve worked on products together with teams from [Valtech](http://www.valtech.com/), [Knowit](http://www.knowit.se/) and [Culturalcare’s in-house team in India](http://culturalcareaupair.com/).

## Colophon
The website was made for the purpose of creating a digital home to collect the writing and the work I do. The last couple of years I have downsized on my social media appearance and wanted to have a simple home where I can experiment at my own pace. The site is hand coded with HTML5 and CSS3. It’s built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The CSS is written with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and minification stuff and other automations are happening with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). I also use [Bower](http://bower.io/) to keep a good overview of the packages I use. It’s currently hosted at [MediaTemple](http://mediatemple.net/). The photo on the start page is taken by [Erik Carlsson](http://erikcarlsson.se/).

I see this website as my playground so I don’t always worry how it looks across various browsers. But I’m keen about accessibility and usability issues so if you find something I might have missed, please let me know.
