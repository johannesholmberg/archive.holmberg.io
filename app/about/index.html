      The website was made for the purpose of creating a digital home to collect the writing and the work I do. The last couple of years I have downsized on my social media appearance and wanted to have a simple home where I can experiment at my own pace. The site is hand coded with HTML5 and CSS3. It’s built on top of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. The CSS is written with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and minification stuff and other automations are happening with <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. I also use <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> to keep a good overview of the packages I use. It’s currently hosted at <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">MediaTemple</a>.The photo on the start page is taken by <a href="http://erikcarlsson.se/">Erik Carlsson</a>.

    <p>I see this website as my playground so I don’t always worry how it looks across various browsers. But I’m keen about accessibility and usability issues so if you find something I might have missed, please let me know.
