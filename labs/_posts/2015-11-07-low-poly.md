As my new project for November I've decided to play around a little bit with 3D visualization in my spare time. I love this [trendy low poly style] and think it looks gorgeous. Almost like small paper worlds.
{: .intro}

The goal for this month is to create 4 scenes in the low poly style and publish them here on the website. For this purpose, and for future purposes, I've created a new "Labs" section on my website which will house these small creations.

{% assign filename = page.cover %}
{% assign ext = page.file-ext %}
{% assign alt = page.alt %}
{% include responsive-image.html %}

So this is the first scene which I've played around with for a couple of days now. My focus has been on trying out lightning and different render settings. I'm happy with the colors and how the rendering turned out. I could have done a bit more modeling for the scene but I figured it’s better to publish now and move on rather than to dwell on it for too long.
